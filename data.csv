This is the case for addressing socioscientific issues (SSI) that involve inter-related personal, socio-political, cultural, scientific, economic and moral dimensions. It is challenging for teachers to support students in adopting and practising systems thinking when they explore SSI. In this study, we tested the extent to which causal loop diagramming (CLD) developed students’ systems thinking. We examined a 2-week teaching unit that used a computer-based CLD tool to foster students’ systems thinking about obesity in a first-year university general education course. Ninety-six students from a variety of majors/disciplines participated in this study. They worked in groups and engaged in reading news, proposing actions while creating causal loop diagrams about factors that contributed to obesity and approaches to tackle the issue. We analysed their pre-, mid-, and post-unit causal loop diagrams (3 × 26 groups) and weekly reflective memos. The data revealed their significant shift towards a systems approach of thinking. The reflective memos showed that the shift was afforded by cycles of construct–revise–use as they created the diagrams. The findings suggest the potential of causal loop diagramming to foster systems thinking in the sense-making and decision-making of SSI. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Considering the potential role of metacognition and KB in promoting conducive epistemic emotions, we designed a quasi-experiment and examined the influence of collaborative analytics-enhanced reflective assessment (demonstrate metacognition) on conducive epistemic emotions to students' KB. The experimental class included 48 undergraduates engaged in KB inquiries enhanced by collaborative analytics-enhanced reflective assessment. In contrast, the comparison class included 46 undergraduates engaged in KB enhanced by portfolio assessment. Students' online Knowledge Forum discourse was collected and coded regarding the demonstrated epistemic emotions. Comparative analysis of the frequency distribution and lag sequential patterns of epistemic emotions revealed that the collaborative analytics-enhanced reflective assessment design fostered conducive epistemic emotions to KB among the undergraduates. Correlation analysis revealed positive correlations between conducive epistemic emotions, higher-level KB discourse moves, and individual knowledge creation. The findings enrich our understanding of promoting undergraduates' conducive epistemic emotions and uncover the relationships between metacognition, epistemic emotions, and KB practices. It provides implications for developing a reflective and collaborative culture, providing scaffoldings and opportunities for expressing and analyzing epistemic emotions, utilizing prompt sheets and collective reflections to enhance the productive use of analytics, and fostering a conducive emotional experience for students. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

Particularly, they allow students to experience authentic and open inquiry processes, by defining which themes, questions and approaches will guide their efforts. This study analyses over 5,000 projects presented at FEBRACE, a national science fair in Brazil, over a span of 20 years, employing topic modelling to identify and examine the predominant themes guiding students’ investigations and designs. The findings indicate a diverse range of topics that vary significantly across time, region, and educational settings. We argue these findings illustrate the authentic and open aspects of students’ inquiries, highlighting SEFs as spaces for culturally responsive science learning. Furthermore, the methodology employed in this study can serve as a valuable tool for similar analyses in other educational contexts, encouraging further exploration of theme selection and project design in SEFs. Finally, we emphasise the importance of equipping both students and teachers with resources to engage a more diverse range of participants and support the varied interests that students bring to their scientific and engineering endeavours, both within and beyond the context of SEFs. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The current study aims to make sense of these possibilities by identifying patterns in a veteran teacher’s reflective noticing of student inquiry in two Grade 5 classrooms. Using a Knowledge Building approach, the fifth graders studied the human body systems supported by a collaborative online environment (Knowledge Forum) over an eight-month period. The teacher kept weekly journals to record her reflective noticing of student inquiry and envisioning (planning) of possible ways to facilitate deeper knowledge building work. Using a grounded theory approach, we analyzed the teacher’s reflective journal entries to identify critical themes characterizing the teacher’s attention, interpretation, and planning of responsive moves. Visual network analysis further traced multiple pathways of teacher noticing and envisioning, each involving attending to specific changes in student inquiry and discourse, interpreting these changes within a temporal context, and envisioning responsive actions that could be taken up with her students. The teacher’s responsive moves focused on leveraging student-generated ideas to unfold new possibilities of deepening, expanding, or better co-regulating their inquiry and discourse. The findings shed light on how teachers may work with emergent processes of student-driven inquiry to scaffold ever-deeper knowledge building in a collaborative community. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Article","Scopus"

A mixed method quasi experimental design was used in this study. Sixty-seven eighth grade students from the same public school attended the study. Two intact classes were randomly assigned either in structured inquiry (SI) or ADI groups. The data sources included a Scientific Literacy Assessment (SLA) and semi-structured interviews. The results indicated that students experiencing ADI instruction scored higher on the SLA-D test and personal epistemology dimension of SLA-MB test than students experiencing SI instruction.

This study conducted a scoping review of the literature to explore different aspects of immunology education, examining various contexts, levels, and content areas, including cognitive and motivational challenges. In addition, analysis covered different teaching strategies and research methodologies. Eight hundred and seventy-four articles were screened, and 20 articles proceeded to full-text analysis. Notably, the majority of the analysed studies concentrated on undergraduate education, emphasising strategies for teaching immunology, with a heavy reliance on quantitative research methods. Teaching strategies that were influential for improving the knowledge of the students were, for example, using games, using simulations and visualisations, using hands on experiments and self-directed learning. The content of the reviewed articles primarily revolved around topics related to innate and adaptive immunity, basic immunology, and immune system diseases. There was less emphasis on advanced immunology and on addressing the inherent complexity of the subject and even less on methods to motivate students to engage with immunology. Practical implications and suggestions for future research are described considering both healthcare practitioner training and immune literacy for laypeople. © 2024 The Author(s).

Based on philosophical, educational standards, and literature analyses, an EKSE construct is characterized as (1) underlying students' decisions and reasoning elicited during experiment design, data collection/measurement, and data analysis/interpretation and (2) progressing in five levels of sophistication: no information, nascent, dogmatic, contextualized, and reflective. This study psychometrically examined the structure of the EKSE construct using the construct modeling approach. An instrument was designed to ask students decisions and reasoning encountered while carrying out the activities embedded in experimental inquiry. High school students took the instrument as a pretest and a posttest to a physics curriculum where they learned to carry out independent scientific experiments. Results indicate that (1) all decisions and reasoning taking place during experiment design, data collection/measurement, and data analysis/interpretation contribute to the EKSE construct, (2) epistemic knowledge develops in the hypothesized order, (3) scientifically aligned decisions are likely to occur when students' epistemic knowledge is at or higher than the dogmatic level, and (4) students' EKSE can improve after engaging in a curriculum that encourages independent scientific experimentation with materials.

Based on previous studies, which suggested two aspects of epistemic vigilance—reflecting the source of information and the claim that is made—we developed the Extended Epistemic Vigilance Framework (EEVF) that includes an additional aspect of evaluating the receiver. In an empirical exploratory pilot study, we evaluated the reliability and validity of an EEVF-based category system and investigated to what extent the EEVF can be used to characterize changes in biology graduate students' epistemic vigilance after participating in a critical thinking course. Results show that the EEVF-based category system includes reliable and valid categories for identifying students' epistemic vigilance. A statistically significant increase with a small effect size was found in students' epistemic vigilance regarding the reliability of the source and the references used to support the claim following their participation in the critical thinking course. However, a statistically significant decrease with a small effect size was found regarding the awareness of the aspects of the one-sidedness of the claim, the context of the claim, and cognitive biases and socioemotional influences on the receiver.

We conducted a large-scale, multi-center retrospective cohort study utilizing historical academic records from six major medical schools in China (N = 1632). We evaluated student performance across multiple dimensions, including final scores that assessed both foundational knowledge recall and clinical reasoning—defined as the cognitive process of analyzing patient data to formulate a diagnosis and management plan. Formative in-tool skill metrics were also included. These outcomes were then compared between pre- and post-implementation cohorts (Pre-MetaGP-Edu vs. Post-MetaGP-Edu) using adjusted multivariable regression models. Analysis also included usage patterns and embedded competency test scores for the post-implementation cohort. Results indicated that students with access to MetaGP-Edu achieved significantly higher overall Internal Medicine scores (Adjusted Mean Difference: +8.2 points, P < 0.001). This improvement was primarily associated with significantly higher scores in clinical reasoning assessments (P < 0.001), with no significant difference observed in knowledge recall scores (P > 0.05). The positive association also varied across clinical topics, being more pronounced in complex system modules. Furthermore, within the post-implementation cohort, significant skill development was observed over time, and higher total usage time significantly predicted greater skill gains (Adjusted OR = 2.42, P < 0.001). In conclusion, supplementary integration of a domain-specific AI educational tool like MetaGP-Edu shows a positive association with enhanced medical student performance, particularly for higher-order reasoning skills, although student engagement appears critical to realizing these benefits. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

By providing an animation-based activity, we engaged students in a scientific inquiry on the atmospheric chemistry of climate change. Students performed data analytics, control of variables, and scientific reasoning tasks, which represented essential skills in the inquiry process. After removing the invalid data and conducting the two-stage stratified sampling, we analyzed 724 11th-grade Chinese students' multiple-choice and open-ended responses. A latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to identify if there were subgroups of students' inquiry skills. χ2 tests were conducted to examine whether the profiles' distribution differed in gender, major, school location, school type, and household registration. We identified four types of inquiry skill profiles among students: sophisticated, experimental, moderate, and basic, based on their skills in data analytics, scientific reasoning, and control of variables. The findings showed that school location significantly affected students' inquiry profiles, while school type, student major, and hukou had a mildly favorable impact. To sum up, the marriage of the LPA approach and the animation-based activity has illuminated not just students' different inquiry skill profiles but also the relationships these profiles have with certain demographic factors. We discussed that it is imperative to recognize these varied inquiry skill profiles and work to bridge the disparities stemming from demographic differences for a more equitable science education environment. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Therefore, it is crucial to investigate factors related to the successful implementation of these practices by preservice teachers. In this study, the relation between the inquiry skill levels of preservice science teachers and the accuracy of their judgments and the quality and quantity of feedback given on lower secondary school students’ laboratory reports of different levels of achievement were examined. Therefore, 61 preservice science teachers evaluated laboratory reports and provided feedback using a rubric, after their inquiry skills were assessed with a paper-and-pencil test. The results show that preservice teachers’ inquiry skills significantly explained the variance in judgment accuracy for all reports. Additionally, the inquiry skill levels of preservice teachers were positively related to the amount of correct feedback they gave in all reports and the amount of prescriptive feedback they gave in the low-achieving report. Finally, there was a negative correlation between the inquiry skill levels of the preservice teachers and the amount of false feedback they gave in high-achieving reports.

A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest research design was used, with a total of 306 seventh-grade participants. A conceptual understanding test, an inquiry skills test, a motivation scale, and interviews were used to gather data. The findings revealed that the students in the computer-based learning environments showed significantly greater improvement than their counterparts in regular classroom environments in terms of conceptual understanding and inquiry skills.

Numerous studies have highlighted the potential of concept mapping to enhance students' achievement. However, comprehensive quantitative analyses focusing on its impact specifically in STEM education are limited. This meta-analysis synthesizes findings from 37 studies conducted between 2004 and 2023, identifying a moderate overall effect size of concept mapping on students' achievement in STEM disciplines (ES = 0.630). The analysis of six moderating variables (subject, educational level, duration of the experiment, concept map construction mode, learning equipment, and pedagogical approach) reveals that concept mapping is particularly effective in science and technology, with the greatest impact observed at the secondary education level. Interventions lasting between one week and one month yielded the most significant improvements in learning outcomes, especially when students independently constructed their concept maps. Both digital and paper-based tools demonstrated moderate and comparable effects on students' achievement. In addition, among various pedagogical approaches, contextual and inquiry-based pedagogical approaches are more effective when integrated into STEM education. This study provides recommendations for future research and practical implementation of concept mapping in educational contexts. © The Author(s) 2025.","Review","Scopus"

The purpose of this study is to determine whether an inquiry-based learning environment in botanical garden improves the conceptual understanding of biological concepts in students over the long term. Seventy-nine 9th graders participated in inquiry-based learning biology lessons in a botanical garden, while seventy-two 9th graders participated in traditional biology lessons at school. The results showed that inquiry-based learning in a botanical garden has a positive impact on the correct scientific knowledge compared to traditional teaching at school. In addition, the learning activities in a botanical garden help students to overcome the typical resistant misconceptions related to photosynthesis and respiration. Even though the number of the correct scientific answers from the students in the experimental group slightly decreased between the post-test and delayed post-test, they still outperformed the students in the regular classroom three months later. Eventually, specially designed interventions could help in the implementation of conceptual change and to alter previous misconceptions to scientifically correct concepts. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

To this end, quantitative data from 537 educators who participated in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2019 national assessment were utilized. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Results revealed that four variables at different socioeconomic levels were perceived to strongly predict teachers' implementation of inquiry teaching practices.

Given the substantial increase in migration, this disparity has been a central concern in science education in many European countries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an innovative science outreach program that brings together migrant students and STEM professionals with the same linguistic and cultural backgrounds. The program consists of one-off workshops that follow an inquiry-based approach and include hands-on activities and science communication in the students' heritage language. Using surveys with adapted scales and open-ended questions, we applied a randomized block design with waitlist control groups and repeated measures. Eighty-three Portuguese-speaking migrant students aged 6–17 years participated in the workshops in Germany and the United Kingdom. Results indicate that both the students and STEM professionals evaluated the program positively and that students who participated in the workshops tended to demonstrate an increase in their attainment value for science and an increase in their self-concept of ability for the heritage language 4 weeks after the intervention when compared with students in the control condition. These effects were particularly pronounced for students with low prior motivation to study science or speak the heritage language. Our results thus show that it is possible to foster migrant students' attainment value for science and increase their self-concept of ability regarding the heritage language through a brief science outreach intervention. © 2024 The Authors.

How students’ data visualization literacy (DVL), including constructing, comprehending, and utilizing adequate data visualizations, can be developed is gaining increasing attention in STEM education. As fundamental steps, the purpose of this study was to understand common student difficulties and useful strategies during the process of constructing data visualization so that suggestions and principles can be made for the design of curricula and interventions to develop students’ DVL. Methods: This study engaged 57 college and high school students in constructing data visualizations relating to the topic of air quality for a decision-making task. The students’ difficulties and strategies demonstrated during the process of data visualization were analyzed using multiple collected data sources including the students’ think-aloud transcripts, retrospective interview transcripts, and process videos that captured their actions with the data visualization tool. Qualitative coding was conducted to identify the students’ difficulties and strategies. Epistemic network analysis (ENA) was employed to generate network models revealing how the difficulties and strategies co-occurred, and how the college and high school students differed. Results: Six types of student difficulties and seven types of strategies were identified. The strategies were further categorized into non-, basic- and high-level metavisual strategies. About three-quarters of the participants employed basic or high-level metavisual strategies to overcome the technological and content difficulties. The high school students demonstrated a greater need to develop content knowledge and representation skills, whereas the college students needed more support to know how to simplify data to construct the best data visualizations. Conclusions and implications: The study specified metacognition needed for data visualization, which builds on and extends the cognitive model of drawing construction (CMDC) and theoretical perspectives of metavisualization. The results have implications for developing students’ data visualization literacy in STEM education by considering the difficulties and trajectories of metacognitive strategy development, and by addressing the different patterns and needs demonstrated by the college and high school students. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Previous studies suggest Metadiscourse—discourse about discourse—helps sustain and improve community knowledge. Do students’ emotions differ during metadiscourse compared to other discourse contexts? Is metadiscourse even possible in early elementary grades? If so, what emotions are associated with discourse moves requiring high-level reflection on prior discourse? Is it possible that such reflection engenders positive emotions required for sustained creative work with ideas? To address these issues, the authors engaged 22 grade 2 students (7 years old) in monthly metadiscourse sessions over four months, during which they discussed how their ideas changed, what they still wondered about, and what ideas they wanted to pursue. Video recordings of face-to-face sessions, online Knowledge Forum notes, students’ interviews, teacher’s reflections, and field notes were analyzed using discourse analysis, multi-faceted coding, and correlation analysis. The authors examined how students’ emotions and discourse moves differ in Knowledge Building discourse and metadiscourse and correlations between emotions and different discourse moves. The results show: (1) greater levels of enjoyment, reflection on previous ideas, and proposals for new directions for inquiry during metadiscourse sessions; (2) confidence positively associated with explanations and proposals for new directions for inquiry; (3) positive emotions associated with increasingly challenging cognitive work. The relationships between early elementary-grade students’ emotions and cognition during Knowledge Building is an underdeveloped area of investigation; in an effort to guide future research a model for regulating emotions in Knowledge Building is presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Article","Scopus"

Mathematics teachers are often expected to teach statistics, but statistics and mathematics differ in important ways. The mathematics teaching workforce needs more opportunities to learn statistics and how to teach it accurately and effectively. Aims: This study was designed to estimate the effects of an intervention. The intervention consisted of a combination of an inquiry-oriented curriculum replacement unit and teacher learning opportunities in statistics and probability. Primary outcomes of interest were instructional practice and student understanding of statistics and probability. Sample: The study sample included seventh-grade teachers and their students (age 13) in a single, urban school district in the southeastern United States. There were 74 classrooms represented in the analytic sample for the instructional outcome and 2,283 students in the analytic sample for the student outcome. Methods: Schools were randomly assigned to the treatment or control conditions with equal probability of assignment to condition. Treatment-condition teachers participated in four days of professional learning workshops focused on teaching a 20-day curriculum unit. The Instructional Quality Assessment was used to measure instructional practice. The Levels of Conceptual Understanding in Statistics assessment instrument was used to measure student learning outcomes. Data analysis used hierarchical linear modeling. Results: Positive, statistically significant effects on both instructional practice (ES = .99) and student understanding of statistics (ES = .25) were found. Conclusions: The study results indicate that the inquiry-oriented lessons in the curriculum—with the support of teacher-learning opportunities—can improve instruction and increase student learning in statistics. © 2024 The Authors","Article","Scopus"

Yet, extant research indicates there are hurdles to fully actualizing those benefits: learners’ regulation of cognitive, social, and motivational processes can be challenging. To help clarify processes implicated in inquiry-based science learning, the current study integrated developmental psychology research on adolescents’ peer relationships and friendships to investigate early adolescents’ understandings of the role of peer social relationships and friendships in collaboration in middle school inquiry classrooms. We thematically analyzed 32 interviews with 7th grade students from a U.S. middle school. Interviews occurred at the end of a semester-long inquiry-based curriculum implementation designed to promote authentic inquiry and argumentation. Results suggest that early adolescents primarily viewed both peer relationships generally and friendships specifically as beneficial to prosocial behaviors such as helping and ensuring fair consideration of one’s ideas, supporting argumentation, and supporting motivation by minimizing the adverse impact of competence and peer group belonging concerns on learning and promoting group cohesion. Early adolescents viewed peers as important resources regarding accessing alternative perspectives, explanations, and counterarguments. Early adolescents also distinguished between types of friends, favoring those who support group function and noting greater prosocial behavior with friends than other peers in collaboration. Findings suggest a need to develop scaffolds to counteract favoritism toward friends and status problems, as well as intervention on broader school norms to support forms of motivation that are conducive to inquiry dialogues. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Article","Scopus"

Aims: We evaluated (1) the impact of guided (vs. basic) activity kits on parents’ STEM talk and directive management as parents helped their preschoolers construct wooden structures and (2) whether guided activity kits were especially effective for parents with less (vs. more) formal education. Sample: Participants were 75 parents with high school (27%) or college (73%) degrees, and their children (Mage = 4.82 years; 49% girls). Methods: Families received five activity kits containing materials for building wooden structures over 10 weeks. By random assignment, kits were either “guided” (included embedded stories, parent tips, and extension ideas; n = 50) or “basic” (identical construction activities without guidance features; n = 25). Parents’ rates of STEM talk and directive management were assessed while dyads solved novel building challenges before and after the intervention. Results: No main effect of intervention appeared on parent STEM talk or directive management. However, a moderated effect on STEM talk emerged: parents with less formal education assigned to guided activity kits produced significantly more STEM talk at the post-intervention assessments than did those given basic kits. Self-guiding STEM activity kits designed for parent-child play are effective for boosting some parents’ STEM talk that has been linked to better STEM outcomes in prior research. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

This has evoked considerable concern given the significant role that inquiry plays in science education. To unpack the complex influence of inquiry on science achievement, this study used the PISA 2015 data from eight Western or East Asian regions to explore the effects of inquiry on students' science achievement and the mediation of attitudes toward science. The results indicated that despite the negative effects that the investigation aspect of inquiry had on science achievement, the explanation aspect of inquiry had positive effects on science achievement for the Western, East Asian, and whole samples. When all of the effects of both the investigation and explanation aspects were integrated, the overall influence of inquiry on students' science achievement was found to be positive for the whole and East Asian samples and slightly negative for the Western sample. This study highlights the necessity of considering different facets of inquiry and different types of effects when investigating the effects of inquiry on science achievement and achieving a better balance between the investigation and explanation processes when implementing inquiry in school classrooms. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Adopting a meta-analytical approach, this study synthesized data from 44 independent samples (N = 38,669) to investigate the correlation between PLCs and TEB. Our analysis revealed a statistically significant positive correlation (r = .40) overall. Furthermore, our analysis of relative weights highlighted notable variability in the significance of different dimensions of PLC, with a predominant emphasis on collective focus on student learning (31.76%) and reflective dialog (24.26%) as the primary contributors to TEB.

The study also identified the moderating effects of certain cultural dimensions, such as power distance and collectivism, on the correlation between PLCs and TEB. We found that PLCs had a stronger positive correlation to TEB in societies with high power distance and low individualism compared to those with low power distance and high individualism.

Following Porter’s alignment model, a two-dimensional matrix composed of components of CCCs and proficiency levels of CCCs was developed to represent Curriculum Standards and tests, based on which to compute overall alignment indices and the degree of match for each dimension. The results indicate that all tests value CCCs, but the vast majority have statistically insignificant alignment with Curriculum Standards. This inconsistency is mainly due to the tests’ more emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, which has resulted in an overall shift towards higher proficiency of CCCs from Curriculum Standards to tests. Compared to Curriculum Standards, the tests measure scientific thinking more than chemical concepts, and the ratio of scientific inquiry and practice is most consistent with Curriculum Standards, but minimally assesses scientific attitudes and responsibility. The findings present direct evidence for improving the quality of assessment in the future.

It leverages cloud technology integration as scaffolding, accompanied by a train maintenance scenario with non-player characters (NPC) to enhance electromagnetism learning for learners. This study involved 90 college students divided into three groups: game scaffolding group (remote gaming teaching activities with NPC-based scaffolding), document scaffolding group (remote case study activities with document-based scaffolding), and no scaffolding group (remote case study activities without scaffolding). The results indicate that providing scaffolding in remote scientific inquiry teaching enhances learning outcomes compared to activities without scaffolding. Learners in the game scaffolding group reported a high level of flow experience, perceived that remote gaming teaching was helpful for scientific inquiry learning, and experienced lower anxiety. Furthermore, learners provided highly positive feedback on the usefulness of multidimensional scaffolding in the game.

This study focused on ways in which embodied arts-based experiences offer opportunities for such engagement in pedagogical efforts associated with justice-centered science. The conceptual framework that informed the study considers the body as a site of learning, embraces social justice in science education and engages with the dialectical relationship between various structures and children's agency, and frames the transdisciplinarity of imagination. The instrumental case study centered on a fifth-grade class of Latinx students in an urban public school, as they grappled with lead contamination and peoples' rights to clean water through an embodied, arts-based pedagogy in their science class. Analysis of video clips, student work, and other artifacts pointed to three findings on how children engaged with justice-centered science learning via arts-based embodied activities. Through perspective-taking in the dramatizing, children engaged with science ideas intertwined with sociopolitical understandings. Through centering emotions that drama afforded, children experienced empathy and solidarity with others affected by environmental injustices. Through imagined and enacted participation in struggles that the embodiments necessitated, children engaged in actions to resist injustices. These findings suggest that exploring children's arts-based embodied meaning making in science is a robust area of inquiry. Furthermore, the findings compel researchers and practitioners to consider emotions in performing arts, and how they can deepen engagement in, and exploration of, justice-centered science. Recommendations emerged for practitioners poised to explore justice-centered science with children through the arts. © 2024 The Authors.

Although previous research has highlighted several benefits of open inquiry, thus far, no studies have comprehensively reviewed its impacts using systematic and rigorous methodologies. Thus, the central aim of this review study was to develop a better understanding of the impacts of an open inquiry approach on students' learning in science. The search strategy was restricted to articles published in established scholarly databases (WOS, Scopus and ERIC), following the seven steps in conducting a systematic literature review process in educational research. As a result, 24 articles were extracted and qualified for inclusion in this review study. Finally, a thematic analysis was conducted to analyse the articles and five themes were generated: i) students' conceptual understanding, ii) students' motivation, iii) students' attitudes towards science, iv) students' scientific and thinking skills, and v) students' science literacy and other science-related skills. Although open inquiry positively impacted students' learning in science, the reviewed article also reported some challenges in its implementation, notably the need for classroom management, flexible teaching and learning, teacher-student interaction and teacher support. This review study provides a significant contribution to science education research, indicating that the highest level of an inquiry-based approach may not be the ‘best’ approach.

This study explores the emotions experienced by 121 preservice early childhood teachers during a training program in inquiry-based science education. Using a checklist of nine emotions (both positive and negative), participants indicated the emotions they experienced at three stages of the instruction: at the outset, after experiencing an inquiry cycle as science learners, and after designing an inquiry cycle as teacher trainees. Only five of the emotions (interest, concentration, confidence, enjoyment, and insecurity) were reported at all three stages, and closer analysis showed that their prevalence varied depending on the phase of the inquiry cycle and the role that students were in (i.e., science learners or teacher trainees). In both roles, insecurity was generally associated with the initial phases of inquiry (problem formulation, designing experiments, and choosing variables); enjoyment was more prevalent during the phases of realization of the experience in the science learner role and of data analysis in the teacher trainee role; and confidence was particularly associated with the drawing conclusions phase in both roles. These results suggest that in order to understand preservice early childhood teachers' emotions in relation to inquiry-based science education, it is necessary to consider the different phases of inquiry, each of which may generate a different emotional response. When instructing preservice teachers in the use of inquiry tasks, their emotions are also likely to vary depending on whether they are engaging with the approach as science learners or teacher trainees. © 2025 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

Rather than performing classroom experiments, students may explore time dilation by performing guided virtual experiments in a simulation environment. We describe the development of a 90-minute research lesson that aims to introduce time dilation through simulation-based inquiry learning. The research lesson was designed, performed, observed and evaluated collaboratively in a team of researchers and physics teachers, following the approach of Lesson Study. Results indicate that the simulation activities supported students in uncovering and specifying cognitive conflict, and that learning gains in the simulation activities were generalised and transferred in post-lesson activities. For many students, however, it was challenging to interpret and explain the simulations correctly, especially with regard to the relativistic behaviour of light. We conclude that a stronger emphasis on foundational concepts and operational definitions may be required for students to yield meaningful conceptual understanding from the simulation activities. © 2025 The Author(s).

For the construction of the analytical instrument, an extracurricular course was offered to first-year high school students in which theoretical-practical inquiry activities were carried out at level 4, where the students were required to propose a hypothesis to begin the inquiry activities. Based on the students’ responses, as well as on the theoretical framework and other theoretical perspectives on science teaching–which also take inquiry teaching into account, the analytical instrument, titled Analytical Map of the Scientific Mind, was constructed. The validation of the instrument was carried out through the application of double-blind analysis of the responses provided by the students in the inquiry-based activities developed in the Chemistry Club.

As PreK-12 science teachers and teacher educators strive to dismantle oppressive practices in their classrooms and curriculum, it would be helpful to learn from Black women science teachers who have been engaging in anti-racist practices before the racial awakenings of Summer 2020. In this study, three different virtual focus groups, or Sista Circles, were conducted with 18 Black women secondary science teachers. Ranging from 1 to 22 years of experience, Black women teachers across the country and international participants in Canada and Qatar participated in the Sista Circles. From intersectional qualitative analysis and narrative inquiry, the findings of the study reveal that Black women science teachers enact anti-racist science teaching by bringing something new to the community; using NGSS standards within the context of the community; teaching at the intersection of history, culture, and science learning and teaching; and building critical consciousness in the science classroom. Furthermore, the findings of the study have implications for the use of anti-racist frameworks within the context of science education that were authentically the practices of the Black women in the study. This study offers insights into how the critical consciousness of Black women teachers can be represented in the science classroom even in times of nonsupport from peers and administration. The power and necessity of Black women teachers are paramount in science classrooms specifically because of the neutral, apolitical ways science teaching has been approached in the past.

The results revealed that research on systems thinking in science education has increased in recent years, mainly from the United States and Germany. Most studies focused on middle and high school students, and ecosystems were the most frequently addressed domain-specific topic. More than half of the reviewed articles used complexity, relationships, components, interactions, interrelationships, and dynamics as characteristics of systems thinking.

In this systematic review of 142 empirical articles, we examine research on inquiry-based science education (IBSE) in teacher education between 2000 and 2022. The aim is to investigate how and with what outcomes IBSE is used in PST education. The included articles were categorised according to whether the PSTs worked with inquiry in the role of learner or in the role of teacher and also according to the cognitive domains of inquiry (epistemic, procedural, conceptual, social, pedagogical, or affective). The review shows that IBSE is used for PSTs to learn science concepts and processes and how to teach science through inquiry; however, few studies highlight the transition between these. In terms of cognitive domains, the procedural, conceptual, pedagogical, and affective domains dominated, whereas fewer articles addressed the epistemic or social domains. Favourable outcomes of IBSE for science understanding, teaching competence and improved attitudes or self-efficacy were reported. Challenges were noted, for example with implementing IBSE in school placement after having learned about it in campus-based courses. Finally, we offer recommendations for fruitful ways of implementing IBSE in PST education and suggest areas for future research. © 2023 The Author(s).

This study investigates student interactions with digital data graphs and seeks to identify what might prompt them to shift toward using their graphs as thinking tools in the authentic activity of doing science. Drawing from video screencast data of three small groups engaged in sensor-based and computer simulation-based experiments in high school physics classes, exploratory qualitative methods are used to identify the student interactions with their graphs and what appeared to prompt shifts in those interactions. Analysis of the groups, one from a 9th grade class and two from 11th/12th grade combined classes, revealed that unexpected data patterns and graphical anomalies sometimes, but not always, preceded deeper engagement with the graphs. When shifts toward deeper engagement did occur, transcripts revealed that the students perceived the graphical patterns to be misaligned with the actions they had taken to produce those data. Misalignments between the physical, digital, and conceptual worlds of the investigations played an important role in these episodes, appearing to motivate students to revise either their experimental procedures or their conceptions of the phenomena being explored. If real-time graphs can help foster a sense in students that there should be alignments between their data production and data representations, it is suggested that pedagogy leverage this as a way to support deeper student engagement with graphs. © 2024 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

To evaluate the effectiveness of the systems thinking approach, we compared student learning under two different instructional conditions. In the experimental group, students received instruction in a chemistry class where the curriculum was designed with a focus on systems thinking. The comparison group, on the other hand, received identical chemistry lectures but followed a more traditional teaching approach. Both groups received instruction on chemical equilibrium, which spanned two weeks and four hours of teaching by the same instructor.

Fifty-four articles met the inclusion criteria and revealed that the terms prior knowledge and prior knowledge activation were often vaguely defined. Further, 30 unique techniques for activating readers’ prior knowledge representing eight different categories were identified. Those categories were open-ended prompts, procedural or strategic supports during reading, visual representations, analogical reasoning, text alteration, augmented activation, extratextual activities, and spontaneous activation. Techniques meant to facilitate knowledge activation prior to reading were most common, although the prompting of students’ existing knowledge was beneficial during and after reading as well.

To address this issue, a novel review methodology employing bibliometrics and network analysis was tested to identify and characterize clusters of research focused on the relationship between school-based science learning and contexts where that science is applied, experienced, observable, or otherwise relevant (e.g., socio-scientific inquiry, place-based learning, culturally-responsive pedagogy). Using a sample of 935 academic papers, the bibliometric network analysis revealed the landscape of contextualized science learning research, identifying 13 distinct clusters of scholarship. Bibliometric and qualitative data were used to describe the research trends within clusters and confirm they were conceptually meaningful and distinct. This methodology facilitated greater understanding of how research can become clustered into “invisible colleges” over time, offering a synthesis approach to grasp interrelated lines of research within an evolving landscape. The methodology has potential to identify other schools of thought or overarching themes in science education, enhancing researchers’ ability to perceive the field as a coherent landscape of interconnected ideas or to identify specific research trajectories within a broad concept. © 2025 The Author(s).

While prior research has focused on students' development and use of epistemic criteria in scientific inquiry environments, less is known about students' metacognitive knowledge about why epistemic criteria matter—their metacognitive epistemic justifications. Investigating students' metacognitive knowledge of criteria can reveal their understandings of the criteria guiding scientific practice (such as modeling), their relative value, and their relationship to epistemic products. We present findings from clinical interviews of student dyads conducted at the end of the implementation of a fifth-grade model-based inquiry unit in which the class developed and used epistemic criteria for scientific models. Students' justifications of epistemic criteria revealed their metacognitive knowledge about why criteria, such as evidentiary fit, are important in modeling practice. We also identified themes in students' justifications for the relative importance of different epistemic criteria and the role such justifications played in resolving disagreements about epistemic matters.

In this paper, we first seek to provide insights relevant to these two challenges via reviews of extant research in three quite broad and important areas of scholarship: (a) the concepts of imagination and creativity, considered particularly through current cultural-historical approaches to early years science learning; (b) the long-standing support around the globe for a range of inquiry-based approaches; and (c) the German constructs of Didaktik and Bildung as existing paths from a non-Anglo context that assist the determination of choices of science for curriculum inclusion or rejection. We then consider how these three discussions can lead to considerations of school science curriculum that better address the two challenges. Though simple solutions for these complex and multifaceted challenges are unlikely and beyond the aim of this paper, interrelated aspects of our three discussions point to curriculum-focussed initiatives focussing on “big ideas” as a way to determine content. We conclude by briefly illustrating these considerations via the example of school science curriculum structured via the big ideas of science: that is, those that are argued to be fundamental to the learner over the course of their compulsory science education. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

This study investigates the mechanisms through which a professional development program enhanced by mixed-reality simulation supported in-service teachers to enhance their contingent responsiveness during whole-class science discussions. Using a design-based research approach, researchers and teachers of students aged 6–16 years co-designed a remote professional development program at a private school in Islamabad, Pakistan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using conjecture mapping, this study uncovered a mechanism through which mixed-reality simulation fostered teacher contingent responsiveness when nested within a carefully designed professional development ecosystem. We found that interleaved practice in mixed-reality simulation with varied discussion framings, combined with case studies and guided collaborative inquiry, supported teachers in changing their discussion framings, which influenced their contingent responsiveness. Our findings reinforced the crucial role of teachers’ intentional framing of the discussion in shaping their responsiveness. This finding extends the theorization of teacher contingent responsiveness beyond fast thinking (thinking in the moment) and slow thinking (knowledge-based reasoning) to additionally include prospective thinking (thinking ahead). Our study also addressed a research gap in in-service teachers' transfer of learning from simulations. We found that teachers applied their learning from the simulation to their real-life classrooms after the professional development program. This study was also one of the first studies of mixed-reality simulation in the Global South context that directly engaged local practitioners in co-designing the technology-enhanced professional development. © 2025 The Authors","Article","Scopus"

A systematic review was conducted, including 102 articles published between 2000 and 2020. Through inductive analyses, the articles were categorised into four groups: (1) articles testing specific teaching approaches or models, (2) articles testing specific learning environments, (3) articles reporting on teachers and (4) additional relevant studies. Within each group, the articles were further categorised into five scientific domains (i.e. conceptual, epistemic, social, procedural and affective) and two categories: classroom practice and other. The experimental studies were also given a typology according to the quality of the methods applied. Overall, the research has been conducted with varied foci and it generally reports positive learning outcomes. However, the main emphasis is on the conceptual and affective domains, with fewer studies focusing on the epistemic domain. Finally, when it comes to methodology, the reviewed articles included many quantitative studies, often with few respondents and of varied quality. Thus, there is a need for more studies with larger numbers of participants, longer durations, more purposeful sampling and with focus on the epistemic and social domains. © 2023 The Author(s).

These experiences cause harm, particularly for preservice teachers of color. They also limit the disciplinary resources they can develop for later teaching science in ways that value and sustain their students' ways of knowing and being in the world. Our research explores possibilities for cultivating new spaces for preservice secondary science teachers to engage in science. In a content-focused education course, we designed for and studied preservice teachers' engagement in expansive and connective sensemaking, incorporating heterogeneity, power, and historicity in pursuits of explanatory accounts of the natural world. In this article, we examined how this course design can support preservice teachers to attune to heterogeneity in ways of knowing in science and to connect to identity and historicity in scientific sensemaking. Our analysis suggests that students' final projects reflected attunements to diverse knowing, communicating, and relating in science and deep connections with their identities and future-making, yet had fewer connections to sociohistorical narratives and structures. We developed illustrative case studies of four student projects, highlighting the personal, social, and political possibilities of creating space for future educators to imagine more expansive and connective forms of science. This study contributes a novel model for preservice science teacher education to support teacher learning to value and sustain their students' ways of knowing and being in the world. © 2023 The Authors.

Previous studies have shown the impact of GST-integrated lessons on student engagement, spatial thinking skills, and/or content knowledge; however, most of these studies have been small in scope and scale and frequently focus on the affordances of the technology, without addressing the context of the implementation and student characteristics for whom GST is most impactful. We attempt to address some of these gaps. Our program scaled an effective GST-focused professional learning and development program to a national audience through a facilitator development model. This paper explores the student characteristics and lesson factors that resulted in student interest in science and technology and careers in those fields. After teaching a Geospatial Inquiry lesson created during a teacher workshop, teachers (n = 82) submitted the lessons and surveys on the implementation of Geospatial Inquiry lessons. The implementation surveys and lessons were scored for alignment to the principles of high-quality Geospatial Inquiry. Students (n = 1924) completed a post-lesson retrospective survey and indicated the extent to which their perceptions and attitudes toward science and technology changed because of the lesson. Results indicate that teacher GST performance is associated with increases in student outcomes. Students with previous exposure to science activities were more likely to have increased interest and excitement in science and careers in science but decreased interest in technology careers. Students who had previous exposure to technology activities had increased interest and excitement in technology and careers in technology but decreased interest in science careers. Geospatial Inquiry lessons also had a significant impact on students who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. After participating in the lessons, students who identify as female reported higher engagement and interest in science and higher interest in science careers. Students who identified as Black or Hispanic also reported higher interest and excitement in science and technology, and students who identified as Black reported marginally higher interest in science careers. © 2023 The Authors.

Little is known about how these differences relate to the progression through the phases of socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL)–task understanding, goals and planning, strategy enactment, adaptation–and monitoring of learning. We addressed this gap by studying the associations between students’ preconceptions of energy within groups and their progression through SSRL phases during an inquiry task involving a simulation. Of 14 groups of preservice teachers (N = 52), 8 groups had different preconceptions, and 6 had similar preconceptions, based on a domain knowledge pretest. We coded students’ discussions according to SSRL phases based on video-recordings. We used screen-capture recordings to code their inquiry activities with a simulation. We applied process mining and ordered network analysis and found that different preconceptions were not associated with progression through the SSRL phases or the frequency of inquiry activities, but they were associated with more frequent co-occurrence of simulation use with several SSRL phases. Thus, shared conceptions were achieved by observing simulation evidence rather than negotiating different preconceptions.

This mixed methods study examined changes in pre-service elementary teachers’ (PSETs) attitudes toward teaching science. PSETs (n=59) engaged in a semester-long university course in the Southeastern United States. The course focused on demonstrating and applying knowledge of scientific concepts and inquiry-based teaching. PSETs took a Dimension of Attitudes toward Science (DAS) questionnaire before and after the course. Six of the PSETs were interviewed in a focus group and asked how the course impacted their attitudes toward science. Data were analysed quantitatively through frequency of responses and mean values. Qualitative analysis was done through concurrent triangulation design analysis of focus group interviews and survey responses. Results show that PSETs had more positive attitudes toward science in feelings attached to teaching science and their confidence in teaching science. Follow-up focus group interviews indicated that some of the PSETs highlighted verbal persuasion, the Cognitive Pedagogical Mastery (CPM) experience of engaging in hands-on activities, and the Cognitive Content Mastery (CCM) experience of using learning technologies as factors in positive changes in self-efficacy and feelings toward teaching science.

The data were analysed qualitatively with foci placed on the variations in the students’ epistemic emotions and their interactions with practices. It was revealed that the students felt a variety of positive and negative epistemic emotions and shaped their practices in response to these emotions. More specifically, the students’ epistemic curiosity and joy facilitated their continuous focus on inquiry tasks and taking a positive attitude towards inquiry. In addition, epistemic confusion and anxiety helped students felt helped them find alternative ways to perform their inquiry and prepare a better presentation of their learning.

The implementation fell into three categories: (1) adopting integrated STEM education, (2) using extra teaching and learning strategies to enhance integrated STEM education, and (3) using specific learning technologies to support integrated STEM education. Student learning outcomes were investigated in terms of knowledge and skills acquisition, problem-solving task performance, and student perceptions. Based on 124 extracted and coded studies (2010–2022), the findings are as follows. All three types of interventions yielded a medium effect on knowledge acquisition and a small effect on student perceptions. Besides, adopting integrated STEM education had a large effect on cognitive skills; using extra teaching and learning strategies in integrated STEM programs produced a medium effect on cognitive skills and problem-solving task performance; using specific learning technologies had a small effect on problem-solving task performance. Some factors, such as task type (inquiry or design-based task) and program duration, may influence STEM learning outcomes. Future studies should pay more attention to the effective design and implementation of STEM programs by integrating the four core characteristics of STEM education, applying extra teaching and learning strategies, incorporating relevant learning technologies, and assessing learning outcomes in multiple dimensions. © 2025 AERA.","Article","Scopus"

Recognizing the effectiveness of different forms of teacher guidance, there is an ongoing debate about the planning of high (structured inquiry) and low (guided inquiry) guidance and their optimal sequencing. This debate revolves around balancing the level of autonomy and the amount of conceptual information given to students. Furthermore, the complete understanding of the impact of responsive teaching, which encompasses a broad range of practices, including on-the-fly scaffolding such as Promoting Participation, Focusing, and Problematizing, remains elusive. To address this gap, this study examines the relationship between planned teacher guidance and specific instances of responsive teaching, particularly on-the-fly scaffolding in the inquiry-based science classroom. A pre-posttest design was employed, involving 164 primary school students (M = 9.9 years, SD = 0.66, 57% female) and one female experimenter. Domain-specific content knowledge contained science concepts of thermal insulation, whereas procedural knowledge comprised the application of the control-of-variables strategy. The sequential order of planned teacher guidance, structured inquiry, and guided inquiry, was systematically varied, and the experimenter was allowed to provide spontaneous on-the-fly scaffolding. The study assesses the influence of planned teacher guidance and specific instances of responsive teaching, particularly on-the-fly scaffolding on students' conceptual and procedural knowledge. Results indicate no differential learning effects based on the order of planned guidance. However, when planned guided inquiry was provided second, the teacher gave less on-the-fly scaffolding. Additionally, Problematizing had a positive effect, while Focusing had a negative effect on students' procedural knowledge learning. © 2024 The Author(s).

Teachers questioned whether the time spent had disciplinary value. Students expressed concern regarding what, if anything, they were learning. This qualitative case study of one such episode considers students' activity in terms of their engagement with the “mangle of practice” and misalignments between their conceptual and material worlds, their exercise of epistemic agency in recognizing and repairing those misalignments, and their epistemic affect during and after the activity. Video analysis revealed all three aspects deeply intertwined with evidence of student engagement in multiple science practices. The students expressed their feelings about the episode immediately afterward and the teacher and IS2 observer when interviewed much later, at the end of the project. One reason for the negative perceptions of teacher and students may be that the alignments being explored were related to the instrumentation more than to the target phenomenon. This study argues that in such situations, students may not recognize or value science practices that emerge, and may need explicit support to reframe their activity as valid scientific practice. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

This research aims to bridge the knowledge gap surrounding the role of peers as scaffolding sources in CSCiL environments. The primary objective is to explicitly implement peer assessment as a scaffolding tool to enhance students' inquiry output in terms of research question, data, and conclusion. Additionally, students’ perceptions of peer assessment within CSCiL are explored. Results: The study involved 9th and 10th-grade students from 12 schools (N = 382), exploring the effects of peer assessment with and without peer dialogue. The results highlight that while adjustments were more frequently made to the research question and data, adjustments to the conclusion showed significantly greater improvement. Furthermore, students’ perceptions of peer assessment during CSCiL were examined, revealing that students generally perceive peer assessment as fair and useful, and they accept it while being willing to make improvements based on the feedback. While students did not report experiencing negative feelings, they also did not report positive emotions from the process. Additionally, the study found that including a peer dialogue in the peer assessment process did not significantly impact the abovementioned findings. Conclusions: This study enriches our understanding of peer assessment as a scaffolding tool in CSCiL, highlighting its potential to improve inquiry outputs and providing valuable insights for instructional design and implementation. © 2024, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

Specifically, we examined constellations of resources that promoted the co-evolution of the teachers' collective inquiry in the professional learning community (PLC) and classroom instruction, focused on supporting students' scientific explanations. We qualitatively analyzed the video/audio recordings of the PLC members' interactions in eight 75-min PLC meetings (11 h) and a full-day professional development (8 h) and classroom teaching (34 lessons) over the period of 6 months. We found that the contextual resources accumulated from the historical 4-year RPP—including a culture of collaborative inquiry, collegial relationships, structures for teacher collaboration, and expertise embedded in individuals as well as co-developed tools and practices (cultural, social, structural, and expertise resources)—were important. These resources, in combination with emerging teacher leadership (leadership resource) and timely supports, such as school leadership and district-based funding for sustaining structures for collaboration (leadership and structural resources), enabled the teachers to launch and drive their own collaborative inquiry and shift instruction after the conclusion of the grant. The harmonized contexts led the teachers to learn across the PLC and classrooms by engaging in co-evolution mechanisms—setting goals based on classroom data, reasoning about instructional practices using various representations of teaching, and experimenting on a set of common practices across classrooms.

Object of study is a professional development programme on experimentation as a method of inquiry-based science teaching. Change variables to indicate effectiveness are (a) teachers' PCK, (b) their beliefs, and (c) their classroom practice. Two experimental conditions in the professional development programme differed in addressing Active Learning: one set of teachers used peer coaching, the other set of teachers was mentor-coached. All teachers (N = 36) visited three school-internal workshops; they were visited twice in their lessons and coached on their classroom practice regarding experimentation. All teachers completed performance tests and questionnaires; a subset of teachers was videotaped in two lessons containing an experiment. Analyses show that teachers benefitted in both formats regarding content knowledge, while pedagogical content knowledge on experimentation remains constant. Teachers' beliefs on experimentation as a method of inquiry-based science teaching improved without favouring either of the conditions. Regarding classroom practice changes surface concerning opening experimentation as well as allocation of time on phases of experimentation. Overall, classroom practice appears to be robust towards change. While peer coaching teachers develop somewhat more advantageous, the gain appears disproportionate to the added administerial effort of actualising this format. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

It explores the potential of a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) curriculum, aiming to provide equitable learning opportunities, especially for emerging bilingual (EB) student populations. To achieve this, elementary school educators from randomly assigned schools received professional development training to implement a novel curriculum encompassing both STEM and STEAM (STEM + Arts) approaches to life science instruction. These approaches comprised: (1) an NGSS-aligned STEM unit employing inquiry-based science instruction; (2) an NGSS-aligned STEAM unit utilizing Arts-based science instruction instead of inquiry methods. The results indicated that a STEAM-first approach was most beneficial in helping students change from non-canonical conceptual understanding toward more nuanced canonical science knowledge. Specifically, for EB students, the STEAM-first approach showed even more promise, signifying its potential to bridge educational disparities. Furthermore, the study revealed that the integration of Arts as an instructional tool to teach science education played a pivotal role in enhancing the overall learning experience among students. Arts integration stimulated motivation, invigorated conceptual understanding, and offered unique avenues for elucidating complex scientific concepts and terminologies. This research contributes valuable insights for improving science education instruction, emphasizing the efficacy of conceptual change toward canonical scientific understanding through patterns of instructional sequencing of effective STEAM integration. It provides educators with evidence-based strategies to foster inclusive and equitable science learning experiences, ultimately guiding students toward deeper conceptual comprehension. © 2025 The Author(s).

However, little is understood about science teachers’ epistemic beliefs about scientific inquiry and the influence of their demographic backgrounds on these beliefs. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 367 teachers of science in China using the Views About Scientific Inquiry questionnaire (VASI). Results revealed limited informed understanding of scientific inquiry (19.2% naïve vs. 18.6% informed), with teachers struggling in aspects like distinguishing scientific questions, transforming data into evidence, and constructing explanations. Moreover, the teachers’ views were shaped by the interplay of their teaching experiences, academic background, and level of academic attainment. For teachers with different academic backgrounds, the length of teaching experience has different effects on their views of inquiry. The study highlights the need to integrate scientific inquiry epistemology into teacher education programs tailored to specific misconceptions and teachers’ needs. It also stresses the importance of diverse methodologies for exploring epistemic beliefs and calls for establishing professional standards on scientific inquiry epistemology in teacher training. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Our data collection instrument was grounded in the GreenComp competence framework developed by the European Commission. We captured three different viewpoints through by-person factor analysis. The largest group, with nine science teachers, prioritized promoting evidence-based instruction while avoiding the political, ethical, or value-laden dilemmas inherent in sustainability issues. While they advocated addressing critical thinking and system thinking, their reasons for avoiding the dilemmas varied. Some teachers feared that addressing such dilemmas might lead to preaching their own values to students, while others felt unprepared or believed that science should remain objective and value-free. The second largest group, with four science teachers, emphasize promoting nature and its well-being above all other competences. Unlike the dominant group, this group of science teachers held themselves responsible for encouraging students to care for nature and to change their attitudes to behave more sustainably. The third group of teachers stood out by advocating fostering collective action in science education. While all teachers agreed on the importance of promoting foundational scientific knowledge, they also agreed on excluding politics from science education. This stance was influenced by internal factors, such as their perception of science as empirical, their perceived role as transmitters of scientific knowledge, and a lack of expertise. In total, 12 out of the 16 teachers who participated in our study suggested that subjects such as history are more suitable for addressing certain ESD competences. Additionally, external factors, such as the role of parents and assessments, were cited as potential reasons to dismiss certain ESD competences in science education. © 2025 The Author(s).

Given how industrial and capitalistic extractive practices have pushed the planet beyond its complex life-sustaining limits, we draw on theoretical perspectives that recognise schools as complex systems, nested within local, regional, and global social-ecological-technological systems. Science curriculum-making in these systems prompts dialogue regarding knowledge and competencies required to address planetary sustainability, as well as ontological questions connected to systems, relations, and responsibility. Consequently, schools are important places for curriculum enactment practices. Furthermore, teachers, students, administrators, and school community members are enmeshed with local ecologies that are constituted in the cultural, material, and social arrangements found in or brought to a school and its local community. In our work, we draw on a curriculum commonplaces perspective to investigate curriculum-making practices.

Simulations are often used to facilitate exploratory learning of complex phenomena, but students still face difficulties in comprehending interactions between factors. This study examined the comparative effectiveness of the Problem-Solving before Instruction (PS-I) approach versus the Instruction before Problem Solving approach (I-PS) in this context. In PS-I, learners are presented with complex tasks that help them understand the domain before they are taught the target concepts. While PS-I has been found to be effective in several domain-specific contexts, few studies have explored its benefits for learning general inquiry skills. The current study focused on the impact of using simulations before and after instruction on the development of Multivariable Causality (MVC) strategy and reasoning. In this controlled-experimental design, 35 undergraduate students completed a virus transmission exploration task using simulations that was then followed by instruction (Exploration-First), and 36 students were taught first before completing the virus transmission exploration task (Instruction-first). All the students then completed a second exploration task on the same topic at the end of the intervention, followed by a transfer exploration task on Predator-Prey relationships. The results showed that instruction before exploration had immediate benefits on learning and applying MVC. However, no significant differences between approaches were found for the development of students’ MVC strategy or reasoning at the end of the intervention. In the transfer context, the Exploration-First students transferred their MVC strategy better and showed more advanced MVC reasoning. These findings suggest that the Exploration-First approach may improve the transfer of inquiry strategies and reasoning by incorporating interactive simulations. © The Author(s) 2025.","Article","Scopus"

Teachers across 11 schools incorporated the graph-science units into their curriculum plans. We analyzed ~ 8000 responses to validated and reliable graph-science KI assessment items administered before the first year and after one, two, or three years of instruction aligned with KI pedagogy. With random coefficient, multi-level, mixed-effect regression modeling, we analyzed performance after one-, two-, and three-years of graph-science KI instruction. We also analyzed the growth trajectories of subgroups, i.e., multilingual learners. Data suggest two years of graph-science KI instruction is needed to make significant impacts on student learning and ameliorated the disparity between students with different native language fluencies.

Material cycling involves the movement and transformation of elements and compounds within ecosystems and serves as a cornerstone for effective instructional techniques aimed at improving learning outcomes. This study examines the synergistic potential of merging inquiry-based instruction with information literacy within the context of the “mini ecosystem” theme to increase seventh-grade students' comprehension of ecosystem concepts, material cycling, modeling design, and visual literacy. Utilizing a quasiexperimental design, the student cohort was divided into an experimental group that was exposed to inquiry-based instruction and information literacy and a control group that utilized integrated audiovisual media. Assessment tools included standardized tests, open-ended inquiries, design drawings, and evaluations of visual literacy. This study sheds light on students' comprehension of concepts related to ecosystems and material cycling and highlights the effectiveness of integrating inquiry-based instruction and information literacy. Notably, the experimental group surpassed the control group in several aspects, including understanding and higher-order thinking of ecosystem concepts, overall model design with material selection, and overall visual literacy, including aesthetic techniques and creative imagination. However, no significant differences were found in conceptual design or material cycling of model design or in theme composition in visual literacy. In both groups, students with higher pretest scores did not exhibit improvement in the understanding of ecosystem concepts. Despite the identified limitations, the results underscore the potential benefits of each individual component (i.e., inquiry-based instruction and information literacy) as well as their combined synergistic effect in bolstering students' grasp of ecosystem concepts. The study concludes by discussing its limitations and providing suggestions for future research. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

Academic resilience is related to not only individuals but also classrooms and schools. This study aimed to construct a comprehensive resilience model in science domains that presents the image of resilient students and describes the mechanisms by which they arise. This goal was achieved through a parametric multilevel latent profile analysis with level 1 and level 2 covariates. Latent profile indicators included variables reflecting motivation, subjective well-being, and engagement in science of secondary school students. Variables related to science classroom and school contexts constituted the levels 1 and 2 covariates. We used secondary data from Japan and Macao (China) collected in the 2015 Programme of International Student Assessment (PISA). The sample sizes were 1594 and 1114, respectively. We identified three resilience levels among students. The emergence of resilient students benefited from science classroom discipline, teacher-directed instruction, inquiry-based teaching, adjusting instruction, and teacher support. In Japan, the most robust predictor was inquiry-based teaching, while in Macao, it was teacher-directed instruction. Therefore, science teachers play a crucial role in building students’ resilience.

They also matter because they are integral to science identity formation and sense of belonging. This study aims to foreground the epistemic and affective character of laboratory work in higher science education by conceptualizing it as epistemic practice, in which students activate their body and mind in discursive processes of proposing, communicating, and evaluating knowledge. On this conceptualization is an emerging construct, “epistemic affect,” which refers to how one feels when engaging with epistemic practices. Several methods were used to provide triangulated evidence for student learning processes and lived experiences in the chemistry laboratory. Students were observed and interviewed using custom protocols based on previously validated works. The empirical materials consist of audio recordings and transcripts of focus group interviews, audio and video recordings of students doing an experiment in analytical chemistry, verbatim transcripts of utterances and non-verbal cues, as well as instructional artifacts (laboratory manuals, textbooks, and reports). Key findings from the study reveal a range of epistemic emotions experienced by students, including curiosity, frustration, and joy, which are intertwined with their engagement in experimental work and exploration of scientific principles. The study also identifies affective constructs such as confidence, pride, and humility, which contribute to students’ identity development within the context of laboratory-related epistemic practices. These affective experiences are situated in the embodied nature of laboratory work, where failures and mistakes are common, but also serve as opportunities for learning. The research underscores the importance of recognizing and addressing the affective dimensions of learning in the chemistry laboratory. It suggests that fostering positive epistemic emotions and resolving negative ones can enhance students’ learning experiences and engagement with science. The study calls for a more holistic approach to chemistry education that acknowledges the role of emotion in laboratory-related epistemic practices. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

This has been associated with calls for computational thinking to be considered a ‘21St Century’ competency, valuable to all students as a transferable process for solving problems and building understanding of human behaviour and systems. However, while computational thinking is a focus of most secondary school computer science curricula, proponents such as Jeanette Wing argue its relevance for younger students, indicating more work must be done investigating its development in early years' education. This study used a structured, problem-based curriculum supported by guided inquiry pedagogy, to explore 6 year old students' learning of basic computational thinking concepts and practices while coding programmable floor robots (Blue-bots and an iPad app). Results indicated improvement across the seven lessons in students' sequencing/algorithm authoring, error correction, and pattern recognition. Furthermore, they revealed evidence of higher order thinking such as identifying patterns in code, and how these can be transferred to help solve problems of different designs. While currently play-based approaches are used to introduce computational thinking concepts and practices in early years' education, results from this study suggest that more structured, problem-based methods should be seriously considered. Results challenge commonly understood developmental theories about what young children can and can't do, contextualised within the field of computer science, and hold implications for early years' teachers' professional knowledge and pedagogy if they are to promote their students' learning in this increasingly important area. Given rapid technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and increasingly earlier exposure of young children to digitally-mediated information, this study provides support for the earlier and more systematic introduction of basic digital literacy knowledge and skills in early years' education. © 2024 The Author","Article","Scopus"

Some conventional e-books may not sufficiently encourage reflective thinking or foster CT skills due to their linear nature and lack of engaging elements. Employing the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM) within the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework, this study highlights the integration of multimedia elements and the use of students' selfies to boost engagement and social presence in a digital learning environment. This study introduced selfie role-playing reading, along with group discussions from various perspectives as an innovative pedagogy to enhance cognitive presence within the CoI, ultimately enhancing learners’ CT performance. Using a quasi-experimental design, 63 participants were grouped into single-perspective or multiple-perspective categories by narrative perspective exposure, and then engaged in online story discussions with worksheets. Reading performance was measured through a detailed examination of their CT patterns via behavioral sequential analysis. Results revealed that students in the multi-perspective groups demonstrated superior CT and reflective thinking levels, underscoring the potential of innovative e-book designs in enhancing CT. This study not only validates the importance of diverse narratives and role-playing in CT development, but also pioneers a method for analyzing such skills through behavioral sequence analysis. It signifies a leap in applying the PIM to multimedia e-book reading, offering insights for future educational strategies and CT assessment in the digital era. © 2024","Article","Scopus"

From a larger dataset of 39 groups, four small student groups were selected for this specific study. Of the selected groups, two were high-performing and two were low-performing based on their collaborative outcomes. Moreover, students' videotaped discussions were analyzed in terms of argumentation and metacognitive regulation during three phases (planning, experimenting, and presenting). Finally, an in-depth video analysis was conducted, which was supported by qualitative excerpts that were transcribed. The results of the present study demonstrate that metacognitive regulation and argumentation spontaneously co-occur; in particular, SSMR appeared to co-occur with high-level argumentation. Moreover, SSMR was shown to be related to deeper argumentation and, thus, to the discussion of the high-performing group. Finally, the results hinted that students socially regulate their learning when they are asking questions related to a scientific topic, even though this was not shown to be statistically significant. To summarize, the interrelation of scientific argumentation and metacognitive regulation is under-researched and, therefore, the present study attempts to extend the understanding of this relationship and the co-occurrence of argumentation and metacognitive regulation. © 2025 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

Using a quasi-experimental design in a Chinese secondary school, the study compared intervention students (N = 102) and control students (N = 245), employing pre- and post-assessments with the ‘Comprehensive Scientific Creativity’ instrument. The intervention involved a biology teacher taking five inquiry-based teaching lessons over a period of two months in each of three 10th-grade classes. Compared to the control group, the intervention group showed statistically significant enhancements in their creativity, specifically in their divergent thinking and convergent thinking, but no difference in their attainment scores or motivation in scientific creativity. The results from the control group suggested that the educational activities they routinely experience may hinder the development of students’ divergent and convergent thinking. Observations of the lessons and interviews with the teacher and students highlighted the challenges of implementing more inquiry-based teaching in upper secondary science lessons in China. These findings provide science educators with inquiry-based teaching strategies for fostering scientific creativity among upper secondary school students, and underscore the need for future research to address implementation challenges associated with inquiry-based teaching. © 2024 The Author(s).

Children's argumentative discourse can be activated by appropriate instruction, but there is little information on argumentation at early ages and there is a need for the teacher to understand how to foster and guide the articulation of ideas at this stage. In this study we aim to assess how teachers' dialogical practices stimulate young children to engage in argumentation and knowledge construction through simultaneously analyzing the teacher's questions and children's answers, from the double scope of the epistemic and argumentative operations. We analyzed elementary classroom discussions of students involved in inquiry activities on plant growth led by two different trainee teachers. Our results show that 6–7-year-olds were able to not only use experimental data and prior knowledge as evidence to generate explanations and draw conclusions but also evaluate and question the ideas of others. This gave rise to small argumentative nodes in which a process of co-construction of knowledge on plant growth and core concepts of the living being took place. We have identified three fundamental characteristics of the dialogical strategies that can condition the quality of the students' practice: the type of teacher's questions, the order or questioning sequence, and certain talk moves to manage correct or incorrect responses and to stimulate peer collaboration. Our results indicate that teachers could involve students in high-level epistemic operations but also implement appropriate dialogic techniques to raise the level of argumentation and scientific reasoning from an early age. © 2025 The Author(s).

To address this problem, we designed and evaluated science and technology lessons, consisting of hands-on experiments combined with interactive diagrams, aimed at scaffolding primary school students (9–12 years) in the development of their scientific reasoning. Our proof-of-concept uses an online application, that lets students work through the lessons while alternating hands-on and minds-on activities. A study was carried out (n = 490) showing that most students successfully complete the lessons within a standard lesson timeframe.

It is challenging for teachers though, especially for out-of-field teachers. This study focuses on biology and chemistry teachers who are called to teach middle-school physics. These teachers face not only a knowledge gap, but also an epistemic gap arising from the distinct epistemic practices that are applied in the different school-subjects to construct scientific knowledge. We put forward a professional development (PD) approach for out-of-field teachers that capitalizes on the strengths and resources they bring from their original field of expertise, and describe design guidelines for a PD program designed to enable them to carry out inquiry experiences in physics with their students. Given our PD approach, we argue that successful classroom implementation should be framed differently for out-of-field teachers. Rather than expecting them to strictly implement the PD activities and thus completely change their familiar practice, successful implementation would entail modifications that integrate new practices with familiar ones. Using the boundary-crossing framework, we analyze three illustrative case studies in which teachers report on classroom implementation. We show how teachers remained rooted in their former practice - biology and chemistry instruction - and at the same time were inspired to adopt physics-oriented practices, for example integrating mechanistic reasoning and deductive approaches. Illustrating the different boundary crossing mechanisms the teachers applied and the boundary objects that mediated this process sheds light on new productive avenues for the PD of out-of-field science teachers. © 2025 The Author(s).

Results from structural equation models (SEMs) with 737 middle/high school students attending the Prefreshman Engineering Program (PREP) in the Southwestern United States showed that perceived opportunities for creative thinking in STEM education settings were positively associated with creative thinking competency belief and career interest in STEM, after controlling for pre-measures and background characteristics. Multigroup SEM analyses indicated that there were no significant gender differences in the relationship between perceived opportunities for creative thinking in STEM and the two examined STEM outcomes in our student sample. A set of mediation analyses demonstrated that STEM expectancy belief, intrinsic value, and utility value serve as key mediators linking perceived opportunities for creative thinking in STEM to student STEM outcomes. However, only the indirect effect of perceived opportunities for creative thinking in STEM on creative thinking competency belief through STEM expectancy belief was significant for both girls and boys. The mediating effects of STEM intrinsic value on both outcomes and the mediating effect of STEM utility value on STEM career interest were only significant for boys and not girls.

These tasks often require students to explain phenomena by taking various causal factors that are mentioned separately in different documents and integrating them into a coherent multi-causal explanation of some phenomena. However, inquiry questions may not make this requirement explicit and may instead simply ask students to explain why the phenomenon occurs. This paper explores an Activity Model Hypothesis that posits students lack knowledge that their explanation should be multi-causal and how to engage in the kind of thinking needed to construct such an explanation. This experiment, conducted on a sample of eigth grade students, manipulated whether students received a short 10-min lesson on the nature of scientific explanations and multi-causal reasoning. Students who received this causal chain lesson wrote essays that were more causally complex and integrated, and subsequently performed better on an inference verification test, than students who did not receive the lesson. These results point to relatively simple changes to instructions that can provide the support students need for successful multiple-document comprehension. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Article","Scopus"

Secondary school students (n = 118) completed a simulation-based inquiry task on force and motion. They were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: the D + E condition (n = 29), in which domain information and exploratory practice were available; the D condition (n = 30), in which only domain information was available; the E condition (n = 32), in which only exploratory practice was available; or the C condition (n = 27), with no support at all. Students' knowledge was measured with a pre- and posttest and a test on knowledge of variables. Inquiry processes were inferred from information students entered in a Hypothesis Scratchpad and an Observation tool, and from a final summary that they had to write. Results indicated that providing students with domain information alone helps to foster their knowledge of variables before generating hypotheses and leads to knowledge acquisition. The results also showed that the opportunity to explore before experimenting does not affect students' inquiry behavior or learning performance, even when combined with providing students with domain information. © 2023 The Authors.

The performance of CPS in practical teaching contexts is affected by a combination of multiple factors. Revealing the mechanism of complex and diverse group characteristics on CPS level is a breakthrough in current research. Aims: The paper intends to integrate structural, motivational, and interactive characteristics of groups to explore their synergistic pathways in influencing the effectiveness of CPS within groups. Sample: Participants were 129 primary school students. Methods: This study created guided problem-solving scenarios. Students worked in groups of 5–6, conducted two rounds of scientific inquiry activities, and completed a group worksheet and a reflective questionnaire. Results: This paper found that the learning performance of scientific inquiry groups is the result of the synergistic effect of various group characteristics. Groups with high-quality performance demonstrate three driving patterns: high morale groups riven by high information interaction, heterogeneous groups driven by high motivation and information interaction, and heterogeneous groups driven by interpersonal interaction. Moreover, the characteristics of interpersonal interaction or information interaction are essential to achieve high-quality group performance. High-quality group performance can't be separated from the group characteristics of heterogeneity, learning motivation or self-efficacy. Conclusions: For cultivating CPS skills., teachers should comprehensively consider multiple group characteristics and create favorable group conditions through group design. They should also promote collaborative communication through value guidance and rule establishment., and enhance the effectiveness of information interaction by designing external learning support, thereby improving group learning performance. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

While numerous studies have examined students’ achievements and engagement across different types of inquiry-based environments, analyses of teachers’ guidance during the process are lacking. Therefore, our overarching goal was to examine the interplay between characteristics of the inquiry-based environment and teacher’s just-in-time support. Specifically, we examined the learning processes and achievements of middle-school students as they collaboratively engaged in either a structured or a guided inquiry-based task and were supported by their teacher. Structuring scaffolds were designed to support the structured inquiry task, while problematizing scaffolds were designed to support the guided inquiry task. Post-test scores indicated a similar significant increase in students’ scientific understanding for both research conditions, despite significant differences in students’ engagement in metacognitive processes during their scientific trials. Students from the guided inquiry group engaged in longer discussions and made more references to metacognitive processes, in comparison to students from the structured inquiry group. A low to moderate correlation between students’ engagement in metacognitive processes and test-scores was identified. The teacher’s regulation of students’ discourse in the structured inquiry group was significantly greater than in the guided inquiry group, though the nature of regulation was similar. We propose that the teacher’s regulation of students’ metacognitive discourse outweighed the differences between students’ learning processes in the two learning environments, resulting in similar achievements in the two conditions albeit differences in metacognitive engagement.

However, how teachers guide students to link and infer new meanings across modes, called “transduction” (Kress & Van Leeuwen, 2006. Reading images: The grammar of visual design. Routledge, p. 39), is less clear. This mapping of meanings across modes through realizing, generating, aligning, and coordinating meanings in representations is crucial to learning and communicating scientific concepts, inquiry processes, and reasoning. In this paper we propose a pragmatist account of how young students can be guided to achieve cohesion in this process. Drawing mainly on Peirce's (1998, The essential Peirce: Selected philosophical writings. Indiana University Press) theory of sign functions and affordances, we describe how, in practice, transduction entails a sequence of meaning-making steps across and within sign systems. For Peirce, sign systems in science enable inferential meaning-making within modes, but signs within these grammars can also prompt, support, and confirm meanings across modes. We analyze student learning in an elementary school astronomy class to identify how transduction is enacted and supported. We draw on micro-ethnographic analysis of the teacher's interactions with students and their artifacts to identify key transduction enablers. We found that young students can engage successfully in trans-modal reasoning if multiple conditions are met, with implications for science inquiry design in general and the teacher's key role in transduction guidance. © 2024 The Authors.

While this metaphor usefully conveys the sense of a complex system that comprised interconnected, differentiated parts, it has been critiqued for struggling to engage with power relations and remains more of an aspiration/ ideal, rather than depicting the reality of current STEM learning systems. Results: This paper critically reflects on how we might think about and conceptualise the relationships between the myriad of offers that comprise formal and informal STEM learning provision, with the aim of supporting more equitable and inclusive policy and practice. We employ a Bourdieusian conceptual lens, arguing that relationships between formal and informal learning organisations might be more productively theorised as a ‘market’. To explore the purchase of these metaphors, we draw on qualitative data from an international research–practice partnership project conducted between university researchers, practitioners and youth from six makerspaces in five countries. Specifically, we focus on data collected via 230 interviews with 100 + young people, 28 practitioners and a small number of parents, plus 23 youth group discussions/workshops and 62 observations of practice. Analysis identifies four main types of relationship between schools and makerspaces (termed ‘recruitment’, ‘outreach’, ‘hosted visits’ and ‘full-circle’ relationships). Practitioners simultaneously valued maintaining a distance and separation between formal and informal settings (reflecting the distinct value afforded by makerspaces) and called for new and different relationships with schools. Analysis explores the affordances and limitations of both the ecosystem and market metaphors for understanding these relationships between formal and informal STEM learning settings. Conclusion: We argue that the market metaphor augments the ecosystem metaphor by offering a more critical understanding and engagement with equity issues and power relations pertaining to STEM learning systems and hence has greater potential to support and inform equity-orientated policy and practice across both formal and informal sectors. © The Author(s) 2025.","Article","Scopus"

Here, we examined the professional teacher identity development of 13 science teachers as they collaborated in networked professional learning communities (PLCs) to implement and revise a culture-setting unit focused on the science of COVID and engaging in collaborative inquiry cycles to identify and refine justice-centered ambitious science teaching (JuST) practices in classrooms. These JuST practices are conceptualized as a synthesis of justice-centered pedagogies and ambitious science teaching. To accomplish our research aims, we drew on qualitative methods, where we relied on transcribed video recordings of 21 PLC meetings and three transcribed end-of-year focus group interviews of two PLCs (i.e., 13 secondary science teachers, mostly white) across a year-long period. As a result of our analyses, we identified how professional learning arranged through PLCs, culture-setting units, and collaborative inquiries supported professional JuST identity development by, among other affordances, providing space for the critical and emotional work of learning to discuss race, affording teachers strategies for getting to know their students and the assets they bring to classrooms, and recognition and positioning of teachers as professionals capable of identifying or developing, refining, and contributing to knowledge about JuST science teaching and learning. Challenges identified included, among others, identifying how the culture-setting units could be effectively integrated into existing curriculum maps and the uneven implementation support from administrators. In the end, what is revealed helps better conceptualize how engaging teachers in PLCs around tasks like curriculum implementation and refinement or collaborative inquires support professional JuST identity development and how such experiences can be more carefully negotiated. © 2024 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

The primary objective was to develop and assess a Teaching-Learning Sequence (TLS) aimed at enhancing secondary students’ mental models about the traditionally challenging topic of plant nutrition. The design of this innovative TLS was guided by previous research and it was grounded in the Model-Based Inquiry approach as it allows to integrate scientific practices and models. To gauge the success of the TLS and contribute to the literature on the effective instruction of plant nutrition this study followed a pre–post quasi-experimental design. Thus, a preliminary (TLS1; N = 95) and a refined version (TLS2; N = 110) of the TLS were implemented and compared against a group studying through direct instruction (Control; N = 109). The analysis of the pre–post questionnaires yielded three main outcomes: (1) The results revealed that students undergoing the specifically designed TLSs attained mental models resembling the target curriculum model thereby proving their effectiveness over the control intervention. (2) The study identified salient TLS design elements (e.g. hands-on modelling, tracing matter and energy, etc.) that enriched students’ learning outcomes on the topic.

Correspondingly, so called eigendynamic effects are an important feature in complex problem solving (CPS) tasks. Eigendynamic effects describe increases or decreases in outcome variables over time without the individual's intervention. Identifying the eigendynamic effects from the start while exploring the system is reasonably an effective strategic behavior when systems are comprised of different effect types (i.e., eigendynamic effects alongside other effects). In this study, we hypothesized that the strategic behavior to identify eigendynamic effects early when exploring the system was related to CPS performance and mediated the relationship between intelligence and CPS performance. In a sample of N = 262 German high school students, the investigated strategic behavior predicted CPS performance when exploring the system (knowledge acquisition phase) and when controlling the system (knowledge application phase) in single CPS tasks and in a set of CPS tasks comprising of different effect types. In mediation models the strategic behavior to identify eigendynamic effects early mediated the intelligence-CPS performance relation in the knowledge acquisition phase, but not in the knowledge application phase.

In this article, drawing from our multiyear partnership with a community-based youth organization, we examine how agency was supported and constrained as a function of the practices we engaged in as a research team committed to participatory and justice-centered education. Our findings illustrate ways that the emergence and enactment of agency, at both individual and community levels, works to interrupt, subvert, and creatively “jam” systems of power. We argue that cultivating agency in community-driven science and technology learning requires an honest reckoning with the deeply entrenched racial and economic oppression in the United States. We contend that it is equally essential to commit to learning from, co-designing with, and working in solidarity alongside the youth and communities that are most impacted by technologies that mediate our experiences—toward unveiling, resisting, and reimagining their powerful roles in our collective lives. © 2022 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

However, little research has studied how high school students position scientists in an internship. Drawing on dialogic self-theory, this qualitative study investigated how students positioned their relationships with scientists in a science internship using students' journals and interviews. Our analysis identified nine different positions of high school students towards scientists. They viewed scientists as busy faculty, expert, evaluator, feedback provider, effective instructor, patient listener, life-long learner, role model, and talent scout. These findings can help scientists and programme designers to tailor and improve future science internship designs and activities, and can contribute to understanding the process of science identity development.

Delayed posttest assessments with new content confirmed progress in developing the rich multivariable causal reasoning essential to science. Accompanying this progress was progress in understanding scientific practice, shown in the way students approached reconciling contrasting scientific claims, displaying understanding of when contrasting causal claims conflict with one another and require resolution and when they do not because they work together in a multivariable causal system.

Some analyses of these data show that the effects of different scientific activities related to IBST carried out with students vary according to the frequency of their implementation. Extending this research, the present study focuses on several scientific activities (Conception, Problem, Hypothesis, Model, Manipulation, Discussion-IBST, Interaction), some of which have not been considered previously. It investigates the extent to which these activities are implemented in teachers’ practices and their relationships with student learning. The study is based on self-reported practices of primary school teachers in France (98) and data on their students (2250) measuring their scientific knowledge, inquiry skills, views of the nature of science (NOS) and attitudes towards science. Findings show that teachers’ practices are diverse, with some teachers implementing scientific activities frequently and others rarely. However, no profile of teaching practices could be associated with high or low levels of student learning. The only scientific activity for which converging positive relationships with student learning were found was modelling. This finding calls for further studies to explore the relationships of the different modelling sub-practices with student learning. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

We applied Martin and White’s [(2005). The language of evaluation: Appraisal in English.

The two groups displayed unique patterns of attitudes towards additional exploration: one group displayed strong, positive attitudes, while the other displayed varied attitudes, including doubt and insecurity. These more complex attitudes in the second group were important to how these students reasoned about the issue, enabling them to appreciate the complexity of the issue, as the expression of multiple perspectives and doubt opened a richer inquiry into the socio-scientific issue, enhancing the quality of their reasoning.

Data sources included pre/post surveys of 367 undergraduate students' and 18 teaching assistants' (TAs) content knowledge, ability beliefs, sociodemographics (e.g., gender, race), and prior chemistry experience. The hierarchical linear regression (HLR) model accounted for 27.4% of the variance in post-content scores, with male students and students with more prior chemistry experience scoring significantly higher than their counterparts. Student ability beliefs was not a significant predictor of content knowledge at the end of the course. Women had a significant decrease in their ability beliefs while male students did not. Furthermore, there were significant differences in achievement depending upon whether and how students' chemistry ability beliefs changed during the course. HLR indicated that student race and TA research experience significantly predicted students' ability beliefs and accounted for 32.7% of variance in this model. Finally, students had more positive perceptions of their TA when their TA held more incremental ability beliefs. These results also indicate that redesigning undergraduate chemistry labs to a PBGI approach does not necessarily level the academic playing field for students who identified as Black, Hispanic, or Multi-racial, women, or students with less chemistry experience. Providing additional scaffolding for students and developing professional learning experiences to explicitly support TAs incremental ability beliefs may be beneficial in reform-based laboratory contexts. Further research is needed to understand who benefits from reform-based instruction and for what reasons. © 2022 The Authors.

Enhancing learners’ understanding of the complexity inherent in pollination systems within the science classroom may help them make more informed decisions regarding pollinator conservation actions. By measuring conceptual understanding of pollination systems, science educators can identify learners’ knowledge needs and inform their teaching in science classrooms. Based on previously developed theoretical frameworks describing pollination systems knowledge, we created and evaluated a new instrument to assess pollination systems and conservation actions knowledge. The Pollination Systems Knowledge Assessment (PSKA) is a multiple-true–false instrument containing 18 question stems and 70 accompanying T–F items encompassing three organizational components of pollination knowledge regarding (1) plant structures, (2) pollinator structures and behaviors, and (3) pollination systems function and pollinator conservation. Results: We refined the PSKA based on expert discussions, think-aloud interviews, and pilot testing before and after presenting a wild pollinator conservation unit within a postsecondary science literacy course. The PSKA elucidated learners’ misconceptions and revealed discriminating items from the three organizational components of pollination systems knowledge. Conclusions: The PSKA may aid educators in exploring learners’ conceptual understanding, identifying areas of misconceptions, and refining educational programming aimed at improving learners’ pollination systems knowledge. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

Throughout this period, inquiry learning has been regularly criticized by scholars who favor direct instruction over inquiry learning. In this vein, Zhang, Kirschner, Cobern, and Sweller (2022) recently asserted that direct instruction is overall superior to inquiry-based instruction and reproached policy makers for ignoring this fact. In the current article we reply to this assertion and the premises on which it is based. We review the evidence and argue that a more complete and correct interpretation of the literature demonstrates that inquiry-based instruction produces better overall results for acquiring conceptual knowledge than does direct instruction. We show that this conclusion holds for controlled, correlational, and program-based studies. We subsequently argue that inquiry-based and direct instruction each have their specific virtues and disadvantages and that the effectiveness of each approach depends on moderating factors such as the learning goal, the domain involved, and students' prior knowledge and other student characteristics. Furthermore, inquiry-based instruction is most effective when supplemented with guidance that can be personalized based on these moderating factors and can even involve providing direct instruction. Therefore, we posit that a combination of inquiry and direct instruction may often be the best approach to support student learning. We conclude that policy makers rightfully advocate inquiry-based instruction, particularly when students’ investigations are supplemented with direct instruction at appropriate junctures. © 2023 The Author(s)","Review","Scopus"

The model empowers post-secondary students as facilitators of inquiry-based learning within the context of an out-of-school time program. This study investigated the potential for replicating or ‘franchising’ this model by evaluating on the following: (1) Is the model replicable? And, if so, (2) what core elements are necessary for program fidelity? And (3) is there a dependency on a particular setting/participant type (e.g., a more rural or urban setting)? Results: Strategic expansion of the program to different institutional types (i.e., Research 1, Research II, and a predominantly undergraduate institution), different geographical locations (i.e., rural and urban), and with various school district partners (i.e., large and small) determined that program fidelity and replicability required 4 core elements or criteria: (i) intentional programming, (ii) staff quality, (iii) effective partnerships, and (iv) program evaluation and continuous improvement. Importantly, we examined emergent themes by each site, as well as in combination (n = 16 focus group participants, n = 12 reflection surveys). These data indicated that Flexibility (21.22%), Student Engagement (i.e., Youth) (19.53%), Classroom Management (i.e., also pertaining to youth) (19.31%), and Communication (15.71%) were the themes most referenced by the post-secondary student mentors in the NE STEM 4U program, regardless of site. Finally, the YPQA results demonstrate general replication of program quality in a “franchise” location. Conclusions: These results highlight the core elements of the NE STEM 4U program for consideration of expansion (through strategic replication or ‘franchising’) as a possible international model.

Data sources included 180 laboratory reports from nine Pre-service Science Teachers (PSTs) and 20 video recordings across two semesters. Using Walton’s argument schemes, PSTs’ development, utilisation and correlation of written and oral reasoning and an argument cycle of premise-justification-conclusion were examined. A Friedman test and a Spearman-Brown correlation were conducted for statistical analysis. The results revealed that there is a positive correlation between written and oral reasoning.

We identified and examined 23 empirical researcher- and teacher-designed studies conducted in the last 20 years that have reported on efforts to help K-12 students learn about infectious diseases, with a focus on respiratory transmission. Our review shows studies of educational interventions on this topic are rare, especially with regard to the more population-scale (vs. cellular level) concepts of epidemiology. Furthermore, efforts to educate youth about infectious disease primarily focused on secondary school students, with an emphasis on interactive learning environments to model or simulate both cellular-level and population-level attributes of infectious disease. Studies were only mildly successful in raising science interest, with somewhat stronger findings on helping students engage in scientific inquiry on the biology of infectious diseases and/or community spread. Most importantly, efforts left out critical dimensions of transmission dynamics key to understanding implications for public health.

Science instruction for young learners tends to focus on the concrete and directly observable. This focus on the here and now of experience can foreclose opportunities for young learners to explain their world in terms of the mechanisms posited by modern science. The current research examined how kindergarten children's models of matter develop as they engage with technology-mediated, model-based inquiry lessons. Data were collected from two intervention groups who engaged in a series of modeling lessons with the aid of digital tools for visualizing and explaining particle behavior across varied material phenomena. The two intervention groups engaged in a common set of modeling activities but differed in the use of one digital tool. Intervention students were interviewed in the week before the beginning of the intervention and the week following the completion of the intervention to assess the development of their models of matter. To provide a baseline for comparison, we assessed a third group of kindergarten children who did not receive any instruction on matter in the same time frame as the intervention students. Data were coded using cognitive science techniques of verbal protocol analysis. Repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted to explore changes across the pre- and post-intervention interviews.

Over a period of 2 academic years, we engaged with nine teachers (from nine schools across the upper, middle, and lower academic bands in Hong Kong) and their Grade-10 classes, which comprised a total of 504 students. In addition to reporting and discussing the pedagogical effectiveness of the teacher facilitation practices designed, enacted, analysed, and refined in the iterative DBR process, this paper presents the teacher facilitation principles deduced from these practices.

Computational essays are a genre of scientific writing that combine live, executable computer code with narrative text to present a computational model or analysis. The study took place across two contrasting university contexts: an interdisciplinary data science and modeling course at a large research university in the Midwestern United States, and a third-semester physics course at a large research university in Scandinavia. Over the course of a semester, computational essays were simultaneously and independently used in both courses, and comparable datasets of student artifacts and retrospective interviews were collected from both student populations. These data were analyzed using a framework that operationalized the construct of disciplinary epistemic agency across the dimensions of programming, inquiry, data analysis and modeling, and communication. Based on this analysis, we argue that computational essays can be a useful tool for fostering disciplinary epistemic agency within higher education science due to their combination of adaptability and disciplinary authenticity. However, we also argue that educational contexts, scaffolding, expectations, and student backgrounds can constrain and influence the ways in which students choose to take up epistemic agency. © 2022 The Authors.

Thus, this study aims to identify and characterize students' mental models of electric circuits and to determine, through these mental models, how the students' perception of electric circuits changed as they constructed and explored micro-level computational models. Using clustering methods, we identified five mental models, ranging between a naive technology perspective model and a more advanced complex systems perspective model. We employed a quasi-experimental, pretest-intervention-posttest-comparison-group design, comparing the mental model development of 33 students who constructed models of electric conductors using the Much.Matter.in.Motion (MMM) modeling platform, with that of 23 students who learned in a normative curriculum. Both groups completed identical pre- and posttest questionnaires, and three students from the experimental group were interviewed before and after the intervention.

Since 2000, scholars from The Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD) countries have been tested in science by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), despite the diversity in national higher education systems. This requires a global perspective on teaching methods and the scientific competencies of teachers. This systematic review addresses scientific knowledge among educators and the strategies for improving this knowledge in higher education. The twenty-five articles were evaluated following PRISMA guidelines. Five large databases (WOS, Scopus, Proquest, EbscoHost and PubSyc) were searched systematically using the main concept of scientific literacy in the target group: teachers, pre-service teachers, and educators involved in science education. Google Scholar was also examined to avoid publication bias. The procedure was guided by the CADIMA Software to ensure transparency and accuracy. The findings indicate medium or low levels in scientific literacy (SL) and low scores in the nature of science (NOS) among the sample.

In particular, many teachers whose academic background and main teaching experience is in biology are called to teach middle school physics and have limited opportunities for productive professional development. Based on previous studies, we expect these teachers to hold different epistemic cognitions from the in-field teachers. The present study builds on this epistemic diversity and offers dialogic argumentation as a means to promote mutual learning among physics teachers from different disciplinary backgrounds. We describe guidelines for designing interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation activities that aim to encourage teachers to express their disciplinary perspectives in the context of inquiry-based physics and to facilitate a deliberative discourse among them. We demonstrate in a case study the ways in which the discourse of a group of in-field and out-of-field teachers unfolds under the proposed design guidelines. Using the Actor-Network methodology and an analysis of power relations, we uncover a complex interplay between the social and the epistemic in the discourse: when interactions become more dialogic and power relations more equalized, the out-of-field teachers take an active role in the discussion, foregrounding their epistemic practices and enhancing the epistemic practices of the group, including the in-field teacher. © 2023 The Authors.

Emergent themes were analysed to delve deeply into teacher candidates’ perceptions of the course. Affordances of the online and in-person modalities included flexibility (online), hands-on learning, and peer interactions (in-person). Self-discipline and pacing were key challenges of online learning, and in-person challenges were minimal. Teacher candidates shared the value of the hybrid model, highlighting the benefit of blended online and in-person modalities and the various strategies employed to support the hybrid approach for engaging in inquiry-based science. These included consistent and organised formatting, digital science notebooks, taking student and teacher perspectives, and connecting online and in-person course sessions.

With this focus on practices, such as scientific modeling, a powerful tool for sense-making and reasoning, comes a need to observe and understand if and how it is actually occurring, particularly in elementary science learning environments. To address this need, and moving forward an international, collaborative research effort centered around scientific modeling, we undertook a cross-national observational study in which we used an observation protocol to characterize scientific modeling practices in elementary classrooms in both the United States and Germany. Drawing on existing video-based datasets from multiple projects, this study's findings provide empirical evidence for model-based teaching and learning and explore the relative frequencies of relevant modeling subpractices (i.e., construction, use, evaluation, and revision of scientific models) in regular, day-to-day elementary science classrooms. This study also illustrates the differences and similarities between German and American science instruction. In general, students in both countries experience model construction more often than other modeling practices. German teachers more consistently foreground anchoring phenomena and students’ questions/preconceptions as part of the modeling process, thus leading to slightly higher overall modeling scores—despite a complete lack of model evaluation and revision in any of the observed German classrooms. Ultimately, however, young learners in both nations seem to experience alarmingly little opportunities to engage in any of the modeling subpractices. Particularly in terms of modeling as a means to make sense of phenomena, constrained by teachers most commonly using finished representations (i.e., models) of phenomena and processes to teach science/deliver content. Our results indicate the need for a greater focus on all scientific modeling subprocesses, particularly the integration of scientific modeling with already established, more general (e.g., inquiry-based) strategies for effective science teaching and an emphasis on actualizing modeling as an authentic sense-making endeavor. © 2022 The Authors.

This is a particular challenge for early childhood teachers (kindergarten through grade two), who have historically valued practices like active inquiry, but have received little Professional Development (PD) focused on theories of learning and orientations towards knowledge. This explanatory sequential quantitative study explored the relationship between 30 early childhood teachers’ Epistemic Orientations (EOs) and their use of knowledge generation practices for teaching science. In particular, we noted patterns of teacher change in relation to a multi-year PD programme focused on teaching through knowledge generation environments. Findings revealed that overall, PD was successful at shifting approximately two-thirds of the teachers’ EO towards knowledge generation. In addition, teachers’ change in EO score over three timepoints was significantly positively related to their implementation of knowledge generation practices. This research suggests that most early childhood teachers’ EO is open to change through PD and teaching experience, but the degree of this openness differs between individuals.

The potential relationship between computer-based model construction and knowledge transfer has yet to be explored. We studied middle school students who modeled systemic phenomena using the Much.Matter.in.Motion (MMM) platform. A distinct innovation of this work is the complexity-based visual epistemic structure underpinning the Much.Matter.in.Motion (MMM) platform, which guided students' modeling of complex systems. This epistemic structure suggests that a complex system can be described and modeled by defining entities and assigning them (1) properties, (2) actions, and (3) interactions with each other and with their environment. In this study, we investigated students’ conceptual understanding of science, systems understanding, and CT. We also explored whether the complexity-based structure is transferable across different domains. The study employs a quasi-experimental, pretest-intervention-posttest-control comparison-group design, with 26 seventh-grade students in an experimental group, and 24 in a comparison group. Findings reveal that students who constructed computational models significantly improved their science conceptual knowledge, systems understanding, and CT. They also showed relatively high degrees of transfer—both near and far—with a medium effect size for the far transfer of learning. For the far-transfer items, their explanations included entities’ properties and interactions at the micro level. Finally, we found that learning CT and learning how to think complexly contribute independently to learning transfer, and that conceptual understanding in science impacts transfer only through the micro-level behaviors of entities in the system. A central theoretical contribution of this work is to offer a method for promoting far transfer. This method suggests using visual epistemic scaffolds of the general thinking processes we would like to support, as shown in the complexity-based structure on the MMM interface, and incorporating these visual structures into the core problem-solving activities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

However, empirical studies on the impacts of engineering design on science learning show mixed findings and indicate that factors such as the complexity of design tasks, a lack of connections between design tasks and the underlying science concepts, and the limited experience with engineering among science teachers can influence learning gains from design activities. One useful approach for addressing these challenges is through the use of technologies such as interactive simulations, which have become increasingly prevalent in STEM education. In the present study, we used a simulation to investigate the effects of task context (science vs. engineering) on students' investigation behaviors and their understanding of science concepts. Furthermore, considering the relative novelty and complexity of an engineering context to many students, we examined how structuring students' responses in the engineering context affects their behaviors and learning. A total of 349 high school students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: science, structured engineering, and unstructured engineering. In the science condition, students used the simulation to investigate the effects of four variables on the saturation concentration of solutions. Using the same simulation, students in the structured and unstructured engineering conditions were directed to recommend the optimal variable values that meet a set of given constraints and maximize the saturation concentration for a commercial product. The only difference between the two engineering conditions was whether structuring was provided in the response fields presented to students as they entered responses for the target variables. Results suggested that the engineering context stimulated students to engage in more comprehensive investigation behaviors as compared to the science context. In contrast, students in the science condition exhibited more systematic behaviors. However, the increased comprehensiveness of behaviors in the engineering conditions did not translate into significantly greater learning of the science content in these conditions, indicating that students might have focused on the surface features associated with the engineering goal without making deep connections between the two domains. Furthermore, structuring students' responses within an engineering context as used in the current study did not lead to significant differences in investigation behaviors or learning outcomes. © 2022 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

We analyzed stimulated-recall episodes uncovering how these teachers interacted with their students and the rationale behind their instructional choices. Through the application of the CRM Framework, we revealed ways teachers can have instructional goals that align with those of a research mentor. For example, our teachers had the goals of “creating an inclusive environment open to student ideas,” “acknowledging students as scientists,” and “focusing students on skills and ideas needed to solve biological problems.” We suggest three functions of research mentoring that translate across the classroom and research laboratory settings: (1) build a shared understanding of epistemic aims, (2) support learners in the productive use of science practices, and (3) motivate learner engagement in science practices. © 2023 The Authors.

Access to a gender and sexual diversity (GSD)-inclusive curriculum and supportive teachers may positively improve the school climate for LGBTQ students, but these supports are often not included in STEM classrooms. One response is to ensure that STEM teachers are prepared to integrate GSD-inclusive STEM teaching into their classrooms. This review systematically analyzed the literature on supporting and affirming GSD in K-12 and higher education STEM education contexts. The 81 selected studies were qualitatively analyzed using inductive thematic analysis and epistemic network analysis, and the findings showed that GSD-inclusive STEM education literature coheres around six highly related constructs: Heteronormativity, Social Justice, Epistemic Knowledge of Science and Inquiry, Identity, Embodiment, and GSD language. Identifying these constructs, and the connections among them, led to the generation of an operational framework of GSD-inclusive STEM teaching that can inform and guide STEM teacher education programs and STEM teacher professional development to develop STEM educators' equity literacy around GSD to foster bias-free, equitable, inclusive STEM classrooms. © 2023 The Authors.

A total of 48 high school teachers with varying levels of teaching readiness (measured by online professional development experience and distance teaching TPCK) kept teaching logs where they recorded daily teaching practices and assessed teaching satisfaction and perceived student engagement. They also submitted diary entries to report episodic optimal experience. Four salient emergency online teaching patterns emerged, which were further interpreted based on the Community of Inquiry framework (Garrison et al., 1999) as four presence orientations: 1) low social low cognitive, 2) low social high cognitive, 3) high social low cognitive, and 4) high social high cognitive. Daily transition of these orientations revealed slight to medium changes. Teachers adopting different orientations were found to differ in terms of teaching readiness, teaching satisfaction, and perceived student engagement. No difference was shown in optimal experience.

Specifically, a total of 3888 tasks from four versions of Chinese junior secondary physics textbooks were coded on the three PISA dimensions of competencies, knowledge, and contexts. It was found that about 70% of tasks were de-contextualized and those tasks involving real contexts focused on content related to the frontiers of science and technology. More significantly, tasks testing ‘explaining scientific phenomena’ were predominant while those involving ‘interpret data and evidence scientifically’ and especially ‘evaluate and design scientific enquiry’ competencies were rare. Tasks requiring content knowledge were also overemphasised whereas the use of epistemic knowledge was downplayed. It therefore appeared that tasks in these physics textbooks emphasised the recall, understanding and verification of scientific knowledge. More meaningful task contexts related to sustainable development should be designed to develop students’ epistemic knowledge as well as promote their understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry are among the implications from this study. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Teaching strategies that encourage scientific engagement are especially important in rural settings, as these students are less likely to pursue scientific careers or use science in their everyday lives. To this aim, we implemented a citizen science approach in science education, an approach that enables K-12 grade students to participate in locally relevant and authentic scientific research, in suburban and rural 5th and 9th–12th grade classrooms. While most citizen science education initiatives are led by experienced scientists, we recognized the additional level of learning that may arise from positioning undergraduate students as curricular designers of the citizen science classroom activities and partners for the classroom teachers. This study evaluates perceived changes in science engagement, science identity, and science competency that emerged as a result of participating in this citizen science initiative, both for the 5th and 9th–12th school students and the undergraduate instructors. Classroom teachers reported that students demonstrated an increased level of engagement with and excitement about science. The undergraduate instructors reported a renewed sense of confidence in their science abilities and a deepened sense of place in the science community. Finally, the educators involved in this project, both classroom K-12 teachers and undergraduate higher education educators, observed the benefits of this model for connecting students at different points in their science learning journeys. In our discussion, we articulate the benefits and challenges of implementing a multilevel approach to citizen science education. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

The goal was to promote 13 PSTs’ understanding of the Krebs cycle in a biochemistry course, using the representational language of emojis which is common in the Z generation’s social interactions, to engage their attention and facilitate their understanding of the complex biochemical process. Although the PSTs demonstrated that they understood the relationship between the specific reactions in the Krebs cycle, there was no evidence that they could generalise this mode of thought and representation to other biochemical inquiry topics.

Biology education has prioritized embedding CUREs in introductory labs, which are frequently taught by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs). Thus, a CURE GTA is expected not only to teach but also to support novice student researchers. We know little about how GTAs perform as research mentors in a CURE, or how the quality of their mentorship and support impacts undergraduate students. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a phenomenological study of an introductory biology CURE, interviewing 25 undergraduate students taught by nine different GTAs at a single institution. We used self-determination theory to guide our exploration of how students' autonomous motivation to engage in a CURE is impacted by perceptions of GTA support. We found that highly motivated students were more likely to experience factors hypothesized to optimize motivation in the CURE, and to perceive that their GTA was highly supportive of these elements. Students with lower motivation were less likely to report engaging in fundamental elements of research offered in a CURE. Our findings suggest that GTAs directly impact students' motivation, which can, in turn, influence whether students perceive receiving the full research experience as intended in a CURE. We contend that practitioners who coordinate CUREs led by GTAs should therefore offer curated training that emphasizes supporting students' autonomous motivation in the course and engagement in the research. Our work suggests that GTAs may differ in their capacity to provide students with the support they need to receive and benefit from certain pedagogical practices. Future work assessing innovative approaches in undergraduate biology laboratory courses should continue to investigate potenital differential outcomes for students taught by GTAs. © 2023 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

Nowadays, inquiry learning can also be implemented with virtual experiments (interactive simulations) or combinations of real and virtual experiments. The goal of this study was to investigate whether a combination of real and virtual experiments is more effective for fostering students' conceptual understanding than a single real experiment. Moreover, the influence of the sequence of experiments within combined real and virtual experiments was evaluated. In the present study, 202 middle school students participated in an inquiry learning lesson working with either a combination of real and virtual experiments in two different sequences or the real, hands-on experiment only. As the main dependent variable, students' conceptual understanding was assessed with a 15-item multiple-choice test. Performance was analyzed with an ANCOVA with the students' posttest scores as dependent variable while controlling for their pre-test scores. In line with our expectations, inquiry learning fostered students' conceptual understanding in physics; moreover, students in the combination conditions learned more than students in the single experiment condition. The latter can be explained by the complementary advantages offered by the different experimentation formats. Concerning the sequence of experiments, both combinations were equally effective for fostering students’ conceptual understanding. We conclude that combinations of real and virtual experiments can be recommended for inquiry learning in science education regardless of their sequence. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Scopus"

A web-based idiom-driven learning program was developed according to the LAs' needs. The program included scaffoldings such as digital animation, science inquiry simulation, discussion blocks, and sentence templates. A quasi-experimental design was used with 362 8th graders identified as LAs due to their school science scores of the previous semester being in the first quartile. The students were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and one control group. The first experimental group received web-based idiom-driven learning strategy for instruction, and the second group received the same web-based instruction without idiom integration, while the control group received traditional instruction. Three types of science topics—descriptive, hypothetical, and theoretical—were systematically organized as learning materials, accompanied by three respective Chinese idioms: a mantis tries to stop a chariot; many a little makes a mickle; and mental telepathy. After nine weeks of instructions, the first experimental group demonstrated significantly higher performance in science. A number of factors related to the idiom-driven learning strategy—personification, humor, and metaphor—explained the experimental groups' better performance. The problem-solving learning context and the online scaffoldings were other factors that facilitated the students’ multiple ideas and questions for argument. These positive results provide an opportunity for educators to change their traditional viewpoint that science argumentation in theoretical topics is always a difficult task for many LAs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

Given that multilingual learners continue to face inequities more broadly in the education system and in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects in particular, there has been renewed attention to conditions that support more equitable science learning opportunities. In this exploratory, qualitative case study, we intentionally centered the voices of ninth grade multilingual learners by examining their science experiences in a Regents Living Environment class at an urban, inclusive STEM-focused high school (ISHS). Specifically, drawing from ecological and humanizing education theoretical perspectives, we investigated the elements of their experiences that were asset-oriented and humanizing, which promoted a healthy science learning ecosystem, as well as the challenges that coexisted. Qualitative data analysis revealed four main themes. First, multilingual learners appreciated authentic engagement in hands-on, science inquiry opportunities, including developing and implementing their own experiments. Students also noted feelings of joy, comfort, and belonging in their classroom environment that were supported by strong relationships and positive interactions among peers and their teachers. Moreover, students underscored the role of their teachers in intentionally co-creating a science classroom community of belonging and excellence. There were, however, persistent challenges associated with learning science and English simultaneously, in the backdrop of a standardized English-dominant, high-stakes accountability context. These findings have implications for pedagogy, teacher preparation, research, and policy for a more inclusive, asset-oriented, and humanizing science education for multilingual learners that broadens possibilities. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Despite a strong emphasis on experimentation in science curricula worldwide, learners still encounter diverse challenges when experimenting. This paper provides a systematic review of empirical research on learners’ challenges during the following inquiry phases: stating research questions, generating hypotheses, planning and conducting an experiment, analysing data and drawing conclusions. A database search and an analysis of two prior narrative literature reviews identified 368 studies, of which 66 were used for further analyses after screening for eligibility using specific inclusion criteria. The analyses revealed 43 challenges at the conceptual, procedural and epistemic level that not only elementary but even university students face during experimentation. Additionally, cognitive biases and preconceptions are identified as a source of such challenges. Overall, the findings demonstrate a lack of in-depth research on stating research questions despite its importance for experimentation, whilst learners’ abilities in the other inquiry phases have been intensively investigated. The results offer valuable information for science education research and provide a basis for tailored scaffolding in the science classroom or the design of effective instructional interventions. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, even with LPs, teachers may still be unaware of the barriers that keep students from progressing; many are struggling with essential pedagogical strategies to support students’ progression. This study thus proposed an educative LP (ELP), a framework that informs teachers about students’ cognitive development and provides pedagogical strategies to facilitate learning. Specifically, we developed an ELP of scientific modelling competence (ELPoSMC), integrating LP levels, learning challenges, and model-based inquiry, to assist teachers in lesson plan critique. We implemented the ELPoSMC with novice physics teachers (n = 32) and compared teachers’ lesson plan critiques with a control group (n = 40). Results indicate that the experimental group significantly outperformed the control group, especially on seven out of 12 functions of ELP. Teachers’ critiques addressed relationships among four elements in lesson planning: student characteristics, learning goals, teaching strategies, and curriculum materials. Experimental group were more likely to tap relationships between ‘student characteristics’ or ‘learning goals’ with other elements, while the control group tended to use ‘teaching strategies’ or ‘curriculum materials’ as a proxy for critiques. The study indicates that the ELP, compared to general LP, facilitated teachers’ attention to supporting students with varying characteristics to achieve learning goals. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Physical science doctoral students take on many academic roles in addition to the role of scientist, including researcher, educator, and student. When social expectations of roles become internalized, they become role identities. We examined doctoral students' academic role identities as a complex system to unpack factors that constrain the behavior and define the nature of doctoral students' academic role identities. This multiple case study used open-ended reflective questions and narrative-style interviews with eight physical science doctoral students to explore how physical science doctoral students navigate their role identities throughout their graduate programme and the factors that may influence these identities. Responses to the reflective questions and narrative interview transcripts were qualitatively coded and salient themes are drawn through cross-case analysis. Themes were compared across data sources to further validate the findings. Participants ascribed the most value to researcher and student identities and the least value to an educator identity. Time spent in a role, institutional recognition, advisor relationships, community in graduate school, and interest were factors that participants perceived to influence their role identities, along with the gender identity of women.

Its goal is to support students' professional development while fostering their critical thinking. In this paper, we thematically analyze how the framework authors' interpretations of critical thinking translate into the construct of cognitive presence—operationalized in the Practical inquiry model—and its commonly used coding scheme(s). We show that the framework suffers from having become a “pragmatic” tool, thus compromising the intended dimension of fostering critical thinking. Furthermore, we draw attention to the “acting” role of coding schemes, which may have consequences for research and teaching practice. In a first step, we examine the theoretical assumptions based on Lipman's and Garrison and Archer's ideas about the target category of critical thinking incorporated in the CoI framework. Although the framework is informed by a community of inquiry in Lipman's sense, we show that the chief characteristic of critical thinking associated with facilitating good judgment is not sufficiently addressed. Critical thinking is conceptualized more as confirmation of knowledge structures and problem-solving thinking within the Practical Inquiry model. In a second step, we systematically analyze cognitive presence coding schemes as research tools for capturing critical thinking. We trace a narrowing view of critical thinking within the CoI framework and regarding the coding schemes that measure cognitive presence. Consequently, we raise awareness of the risks in educational research arising from the complexity-reducing modeling and operationalizing of multifaceted educational concerns, such as critical thinking in a community of inquiry. © 2022 The Authors","Article","Scopus"

Ideally, this learning mirrors authentic scientific inquiry through student engagement in three key epistemic practices: flexibility and creativity, knowledge construction, and collaboration. This paper draws on findings from a larger research study investigating the implementation of a guided-inquiry multimodal approach to teaching science. It reports on a case study of three Australian Year 9 science students investigating sustainable design strategies for houses, as a summative task. Through a post-hoc analysis, this paper explores how, and to what extent, the task supported the epistemic practices of authentic scientific inquiry. To address these questions, the author developed and applied an Authentic Inquiry Framework (AIF) to analyse the students’ dialogue and interactions during this task. The findings reveal that the students applied a flexible and creative approach to addressing their inquiry questions, through their own experimental design and engagement in provisional and collaborative knowledge construction. To support their investigation, the students were also able to productively integrate disciplinary-specific tools and technologies. © 2023 The Author(s).

Both the students (females) and the TRM (male) are Arab citizens of Israel, and the school is a public Arab school in Israel. Data were collected through videotaped participant observation of authentic working sessions and interviews with the TRM and the students. The analysis combines an ethnographic account with discourse analysis informed by a sociolinguistic approach that aims to answer the following research questions: (1) how are a teacher's identity-narratives reified in teacher–student discourse in authentic sessions of mentoring students' inquiry? (2) how do they shape students' learning? and (3) how do they emerge from social–historical contexts? The findings problematize the challenges involved in engaging students from nondominant communities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics learning. The analysis articulates the complexity of this challenge by showing how teachers' identity narratives shape the social construction of student–teacher discourse, generate tensions that undermine successful implementations of reformed learning experiences, and how this vicious cycle is profoundly influenced by the embedding social and historical contexts.

In this comparative study, we analysed the Czech and Slovak intended curricula of science subjects (physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and geology) and mathematics by comparing their national curriculum documents in terms of learning outcomes at the lower secondary level (ISCED level 2). Our analysis showed significant differences in the number of obligatory learning outcomes, which were much higher in the Slovak curriculum than in the Czech curriculum. The structure of these outcomes also differed across subjects and between countries. Nevertheless, the cognitive demands of the learning outcomes analysed using the revised Bloom’s taxonomy were similar in the two countries, but metacognitive knowledge and higher-level cognitive processes were rarely represented in either. Additionally, by inductive content analysis of the Slovak curriculum document, we identified two significant groups of cross-curricular requirements, namely outcomes related to scientific inquiry and outcomes requiring working with information. Overall, these learning outcomes are underrepresented in both analysed documents (particularly in the Czech document) even though the skills that these outcomes develop are in high demand in the current context. © 2023 Charles University, Prague.

Models have been used as a pivotal science and engineering tool to investigate, represent, explain, and predict phenomena or solve problems that involve multi-faceted systems across many fields. To fully explain complex phenomena or solve problems using models requires both systems thinking (ST) and computational thinking (CT). This study proposes a theoretical framework that uses modeling as a way to integrate ST and CT. We developed a framework to guide the complex process of developing curriculum, learning tools, support strategies, and assessments for engaging learners in ST and CT in the context of modeling. The framework includes essential aspects of ST and CT based on selected literature, and illustrates how each modeling practice draws upon aspects of both ST and CT to support explaining phenomena and solving problems.

Drawing upon the design-based research paradigm, AIM–TRU created the initial design for the professional learning cycle and wanted to engage in continued iterative redesign as the year progressed. This necessitated a method, common among those who adjust their designs when applying them in context, by which to document and justify changes made over time to our model. The research contained in this article used qualitative methods to articulate and test the design underlying our professional learning cycle by advancing conjecture mapping, a device by which the embodiments of the design are made transparent to be analyzed in practice. Results: The initial design conjectures and activity structures teachers engaged in through our model of professional learning were refined to address three themes that emerged. Firstly, it was found that the ways participants engaged with the mathematics of the lesson were underwhelming, in large part, because our own definition of what rich talk around mathematics should entail was lacking in details such as the mathematical objects in the lesson, the presence of multiple solution pathways, or the various representations that students could use. Second, talk structures did not always allow for equitable exchanges among all teachers. Finally, activity structures did not encourage teachers to delve deeply into the mathematics so they could perceive the lesson as a coherent piece of their own classroom curriculum. Our design conjectures and activity structures were revised over the course of the year. Conclusions: Our use of conjecture mapping allowed us to address the concern with research–practice partnerships that they should develop and utilize tools that make the systemic inquiry they engage in transparent, allowing for other researchers, practitioners, and stakeholders to see the complete design process and make use of the findings for their local context. Implications for this process as a tool for those who pilot and scale professional development are raised and addressed. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

However, these programs often fall short of including learners as agents in the entire process, and thus contrast with the growing open science movement within scientific communities. Notably, study ideation and peer review, which are central to the making of science, are typically reserved for professional scientists. This study describes the implementation of an open science curriculum that engages high school students in a full cycle of scientific inquiry. We explored the focus and quality of students’ study designs and peer reviews, and their perceptions of open science based on their participation in the program. Specifically, we implemented a human brain and behavior citizen science unit in 6 classrooms across 3 high schools. After learning about open science and citizen science, students (N = 104) participated in scientist-initiated research studies, and then collaboratively proposed their own studies to investigate personally interesting questions about human behavior and the brain. Students then peer reviewed proposals of students from other schools. Based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis of students’ artifacts created in-unit and on a pre and posttest, we describe their interests, abilities, and self-reported experiences with study design and peer review. Our findings suggest that participation in open science in a human brain and behavior research context can engage students with critical aspects of experiment design, as well as with issues that are unique to human subjects research, such as research ethics. Meanwhile, the quality of students’ study designs and reviews changed in notable, but mixed, ways: While students improved in justifying the importance of research studies, they did not improve in their abilities to align methods to their research questions. In terms of peer review, students generally reported that their peers' feedback was helpful, but our analysis showed that student reviewers struggled to articulate concrete recommendations for improvement. In light of these findings, we discuss the need for curricula that support the development of research and review abilities by building on students’ interests, while also guiding students in transferring these abilities across a range of research foci. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

Divergent peer ideas can enrich students' thinking and encourage curiosity. Meanwhile, similar peer ideas can promote convergent thinking that can reinforce understanding. However, students need guidance in critically evaluating peer ideas in relation to their own, and in recognizing the influence of peers’ ideas. Guided by the Knowledge Integration framework, we explore whether students’ perceptions of the impact of peers’ ideas align with the revisions made to their written explanations. In a technology-rich, classroom-based inquiry unit on cancer cell division, Grade 7 students (N = 144) investigated the effects of different cancer treatments on cell division, and developed explanations for a recommended treatment. We prompted one group of students to visit a class repository to seek peer ideas similar to their own, and another to seek ideas different from their own. Both groups then revised their recommendations. Based on analyses of students' reflections, initial and revised explanations, and pre and posttests, we found that students prompted to seek divergent ideas perceived peers’ ideas to be more impactful, even though both groups of students revised at the same rate and made similar pre to posttest gains. This study suggests a need to attend to students’ perceptions of the roles of their peers, particularly in environments designed to reflect authentic processes of the social construction of scientific knowledge. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

A solid grasp of scientific principles is vital for fostering innovation and achieving sustainable development worldwide. Utilizing data from the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), this study inquiries into various factors impacting grade eight students' science literacy in the TIMSS 2019 assessment. Exploring student socioeconomic status, cultural background, attitudes towards science, school organisation, teacher experiences, and country-level variables, we aimed to identify predictive associations with science literacy. Additionally, we correlated TIMSS 2019 results with the United Nations Development Program's Human Development Index (HDI). Employing three-level Hierarchical Linear Modeling, we assessed which student, teacher, and country-level variables were linked to grade 8 science literacy. Results indicate that the students' socioeconomic resources and motivation/confidence in science positively influence science literacy. Conversely, a higher percentage of science items covered in national curricula was weakly associated with lower science literacy scores. Teachers reporting greater teaching limitations due to student needs showed negative correlations with science scores. At the country level, the HDI emerged as the strongest correlate with grade 8 science literacy. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of science literacy and its interplay with various socio-cultural and educational factors on a global scale. © 2024 The Author(s).

Through convenience sampling, a total of 173 JHS students from a private school in Davao Region, Philippines, participated in this study. Employing a convergent parallel mixed method design, data were collected using the Student Understanding of Science and Scientific Inquiry questionnaire. Analyses of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that the sampled JHS students did not have well-informed views of various NOS aspects.

Studies have shown that experiences and management of uncertainty regarding the epistemic practices of science can support learning. Whereas the common strategies of supporting students in handling uncertainty rely on the teacher knowing the preferred outcomes and answers, few studies have explored settings in which no one can give the right answers to students. In this study, we explore how Finnish, suburban secondary school students (aged 13–14 years) respond to epistemic uncertainty during an ecological citizen science inquiry, in which the aim is to produce novel scientific knowledge. Drawing from qualitative interaction analysis of video and interview data, we articulate three responses to uncertainty that arise when students try to make optimal choices during the inquiry: they (a) envision alternative narrative scenarios and hypothesis; (b) accept and maintain it as part of their argumentation practices, and (c) flexibly reframe their research activities and goals. The findings indicate that the citizen science setting can allow students to reframe epistemic uncertainty in ways that are typical of scientific practices even without deliberate scaffolding by the teacher. We suggest that incorporating experiences of uncertainty that are shared by students and teachers in pedagogical design can support doing and learning science in different settings. © 2023 The Authors.

While much of this existing research is based on international large-scale assessment studies, we still lack a clear understanding of the factors that influence the quality of inquiry-based science teaching in actual classroom practices. In this paper, we operationalise teaching quality through an observation manual, and we drew on this manual to systematically analyse video data of instructional practices in 20 Norwegian science classrooms at the primary and lower-secondary school level (73 observed lessons and about 450 students). We identified varying quality in the individual inquiry phases and differences between primary and lower-secondary schools. We observed that primary-school students collected and documented data more systematically than lower-secondary students and that consolidations were slightly more emphasised and of higher quality at the lower-secondary than at the primary level. Moreover, our findings indicate that inquiry-based teaching gave students more freedom to make their own choices and increased the quality of student participation in the classroom. Based on our findings, we discuss how teachers can improve the quality of inquiry-based instruction and empower students in the classroom. © 2023 The Author(s).

However, few attempts have been undertaken to foster students’ motivation towards learning complex skills in environments based on the 4C/ID model. This study explores the effects of providing autonomy, competence and relatedness support (in Deci and Ryan, Psychol Inquiry 11(4): 227–268, https://doi.org/10.1207/S15327965PLI1104_01, 2000) in a 4C/ID based online learning environment on upper secondary school behavioral sciences students’ cognitive and motivational outcomes. Students’ cognitive outcomes are measured by means of a research skills test consisting of short multiple choice and short answer items (in order to assess research skills in a broad way), and a research skills task in which students are asked to integrate their skills in writing a research proposal (in order to assess research skills in an integrative manner). Students’ motivational outcomes are measured by means of students’ autonomous and controlled motivation, and students’ amotivation. A pretest-intervention-posttest design was set up in order to compare 233 upper secondary school behavioral sciences students’ outcomes among (1) a 4C/ID based online learning environment condition, and (2) an identical condition additively providing support for students’ need satisfaction. Both learning environments proved equally effective in improving students’ scores on the research skills test. Students in the need supportive condition scored higher on the research skills task compared to their peers in the baseline condition. Students’ autonomous and controlled motivation were not affected by the intervention. Although, unexpectedly, students’ amotivation increased in both conditions, students’ amotivation was lower in the need supportive condition compared to students in the baseline condition. Theoretical relationships were established between students’ need satisfaction, students’ motivation (autonomous, controlled, and amotivation), and students’ cognitive outcomes.

But STSPs require partners to cross boundaries between the cultures of science and schooling, which is extremely difficult. This three-year case study illuminates how successful designers tackled boundary crossing challenges while creating a scalable STSP for environmental education. Analysis of data gathered from three sources – designer-generated documents, interviews with designers, and researchers’ observations of the designer work - through an in-depth participant-observation approach revealed how designers (curriculum writers and partner ecologists) made it possible for middle school students and teachers from partner schools to contribute climate-related data to the ecologists’ research and to other citizen science programs, while accommodating teacher preferences and curricular constraints to pursue educational goals. Findings about how designers used specific methods and created curriculum supports to aid processes of boundary crossing are discussed in light of relevant literature, highlighting their considerations about specific stakeholder needs related to pedagogical, curricular, and scientific goals of the partnership. Further, distilled from the empirical findings and in light of relevant literature are three guidelines in designing for STSPs to foster student inquiry, to support teachers, and to provide multiple benefits through the STSP. These findings and guidelines can help designers anticipate and attend to boundary crossing challenges in STSPs designed for environmental education, with broader implications for science education in general. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

However, the benefits of using this pedagogy with ELs have not been heavily explored. This article discusses the use of modeling-based evolution and population ecology pedagogical units in a sheltered biology high school class for ELs. A sheltered EL class is one where only ELs are enrolled and they learn both language and science concurrently. This article specifies the at the scaffolding used to adjust the pedagogy for this unique set of students. The effectiveness of this method was assessed using a convergent mixed method case study design. Data was collected using assessments in content, scientific reasoning and attitudes towards science (i.e., self-efficacy, fascination, and valuation of science) as well as teacher interviews, and classroom observations. The cases were an EL modeling-based sheltered biology class, and two non-EL inquiry-based biology classes, all at the upper secondary level. The EL modeling cohort achieved posttest comparison content scores that were not significantly different from the non-EL cohort and significantly higher posttest scientific reasoning scores. The effect sizes in both of these cases were much larger for the EL cohort. The affective assessments demonstrated intriguing results with the EL cohort having a greater fascination with science than the non-EL cohort but a decline in self-efficacy. Both cohorts valued science to the same extent. This methodology holds promise in helping to decrease the science gap between ELs and non-ELs taught with inquiry-based pedagogies. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Because the studies of sensemaking are loosely linked to those of scientific reasoning, however, they have provided little practical insight into how students can make scientific sense, rather than any sense, of natural phenomena. Therefore, in this position paper, we discuss the close relationship between sensemaking and abduction. Sensemaking refers to a prolonged process of resolving a gap or inconsistency in current knowledge and understanding by constructing an explanation of a phenomenon. Abduction is a form of scientific reasoning to generate explanatory hypotheses about the evidence embedded in a phenomenon based on available resources. Abduction can play a crucial role in sensemaking by providing a mechanism for generating a plausible explanation of a target phenomenon and should be adapted for science teaching and learning for students' sensemaking through engagement in science practices. In particular, to develop scientific sensemaking in students, the teacher should help students identify critical evidence, provide students with critical resources, and encourage students to use the method of multiple working hypotheses, so that the students can construct scientifically sound and valid explanations of natural phenomena. It is suggested that further research explore and collect exemplary cases of science teachers effectively supporting students to achieve scientific sensemaking through abduction. © 2024 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

However, little is known about peer-to-peer help-giving in online learning environments, and online students may find it difficult to receive the help they need to succeed. Specifically, we have little knowledge of the factors contributing to productive helping behavior in online spaces, as well as how these factors may support students’ online learning experiences. Thus, the aim of the present study was to understand the conditions underlying effective peer help-giving in online college course discussion forums. To this end, we surveyed 88 college students about what they found helpful or unhelpful in examples of replies to requests for help posted to an online statistics college course discussion forum. A qualitative analysis of participants’ written responses using a grounded theory approach yielded a model for assessing the helpfulness of peer help-giving replies within the discussion forum context. We learned that online help-giving replies could take the form of direct help—such as being elaborated, accurate, relevant, and/or understandable to the help-seeker—or indirect help—such as being encouraging, resource providing, calling to the community, and/or being concise. Our emergent online-specific model of academic help-giving contributes to existing theory by illustrating how peer help-giving replies can be structured to promote social, cognitive, and teaching presence in online communities of inquiry. Ultimately, these findings could inform practices that improve online learning opportunities for students. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

While previous research addresses this problem through aspects of policy making, design, and teachers' identity, we suggest a focus on teachers' engagement in learning during PD sessions. Engagement is critical for learning processes and outcomes and affects teachers' professional learning, and, hence, their teaching. Yet little research explores teachers' engagement during professional learning. Most researchers approach engagement from a psychological perspective, using self-report tools, usually questionnaires. To enable a more complete understanding of science teacher engagement in PD, we offer a novel multimodal contextual perspective on engagement, one that perceives engagement as embodied, situated, local, and dynamic. We present a multimodal situated analytical tool referring to the expected behavior in specific contexts, as defined by the norms of the situation and its participants. To develop the tool and apply it, we used video-recorded PD sessions of Israeli elementary and middle school science teachers, focusing our analysis on the engagement of 10 teachers over 21.5 h. We used multimodal analysis to map teachers' engagement in relation to the requested action, referring to: (1) five engagement levels determined by the expected behavior; (2) different engagement modalities—verbal, body posture and gestures, gaze, and facial expressions; and (3) engagement duration. We demonstrate the potential of this analytical framework to advance the understanding of PD interactions by comparing: (1) two teachers' engagement in the same activity; and (2) teachers' engagement in three PD activities: whole-class learning, game playing, and inquiry-into-practice. The analysis reveals differences within and between teachers, as well as between the activities, in levels of engagement and alignment between modalities. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings and suggest how the tool may be applied in research. © 2022 The Authors.

However, few studies have looked at how using the interpersonal, structural, cultural, and disciplinary domains of power sheds light on how women of color differently navigate the various cultures of formal and informal schooling as well as college science and math departments. This paper uses narrative inquiry methodology to examine how a young Black woman constructs science and math identities through stories about her previous experiences becoming a science and math person. By also framing it within intersectionality and employing a storied-identity lens, this study provides insight into how stories that shape identities inform her science and math identities. Specifically, this study looked at how she navigated the emotions and social experiences that fostered an interwoven storied science, math, and racial identity across different times, spaces, and settings. It highlights how a strong sense of belonging in her science and math trajectories was positively influenced through various sources and moments of recognition from community influences (e.g., family, peers, and faculty) and structural disruptions (e.g., the HBCU she attended and STEM camp). Despite negative emotions of self-doubt and frustration were present when her science, math, racial, and smart student identities came into conflict, she leveraged the positive emotions of joy and pride in her interwoven science and math storylines, which strengthened not only her science and math identities but also her racial identity. The study underscores the importance of leveraging counter-narratives of resilience as a resilience strategy but also practicing acceptance and self-compassion when navigating tensions between racial, science, math, and smart-student identities for women of color in STEM. The study's conclusions add to the call for structural changes within K-12 and higher education that are crucial for equity goals within STEM education. © 2022 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

Conceptual understanding can be fostered through inquiry learning with experiments. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic school closures hands-on experiments could hardly be realized. Fortunately, digital technologies allow for conducting experiments virtually by using interactive simulations or observing video recordings of hands-on experiments. In the present study, 154 seventh graders in remote schooling were involved in inquiry learning using either a combination of virtual and video experiments in two different orders or only virtual experiments. We hypothesized that in general inquiry learning fosters students' conceptual understanding in physics, which could be confirmed. Moreover, we expected the combinations to be more effective than learning with virtual experiments only due to the complementary roles of the prior, which was, however, not the case. We conclude that virtual and video experiments can be recommended to teachers if hands-on experimentation is not possible. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Scopus"

It was conducted in naturalistic learning settings, involving sixteen primary school students and lasting approximately three months. The students' usage data of an AI agent and their reflection essays about the interactions with the AI agent were analyzed using cluster analysis and epistemic network analysis based on the frameworks of community of inquiry and students' approaches to learning. The results suggest four clusters of students, each with its distinct way of interacting with AI for language learning. More importantly, the comparisons of the four clusters of students reveal that even in AI-supported learning, not everyone can benefit from the potential promised by AI. The deep approach to AI-supported learning may amplify the benefits of AI's personalized guidance and strengthen the sense of the human-AI learning community.

The purpose was to uncover new knowledge about facilitation of the group, and how the 10 high school science teachers participated in it. Data sources included the authors’ meeting notes and reflective conversations, audio recordings of the group meetings, and teachers’ products. Findings included uncovering aspects of the facilitation process that led to a successful online CoP, factors related to developing trust among its members, and methods to deal with tensions within the group. The tensions arose from evolving differences about the group's goals, the need for clarity about implicit power structures, and the separation between teachers’ workplaces and the university. The study also demonstrated how in an online CoP, all its members can take on roles of experts, novices, and learners. Although the study was conducted during the pandemic, the findings are relevant to facilitating online or face-to-face teacher meetings. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The phrases “habits of mind, scientific method, processes of science, inquiry skills, nature of science, practices of science” reflect this obsession. However, historians look with skepticism at universal notions of science and endorse truth-seeking circumscribed by context. Indeed, inadequate appreciation of diversity may lead to the mistrust of disciplines that appear to depart from simplistic notions of “the” scientific method and thus imperil the political will to search for solutions to the problems of climate change, extinction and environmental degradation, and global pandemic. Accordingly, science educators stand at a crossroads. They can choose to reinforce scientific naivete by following the long-standing quest for unity among the sciences as guidance for what to teach, or they may accept the disunity of disciplines, teach the value of diverse sciences to solve societal problems and cultivate trust in appropriate responses to distinct challenges. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

This study was inspired by such conflicting reports and aimed to clarify the associations of science-specific, inquiry-related activities and epistemological beliefs with students’ mathematical and scientific literacies. Results: A secondary analysis of the database from the Programme for International Student Assessment 2015 of Australia (N1= 14,530) and Taiwan (N2 = 7708) utilizing structural equation modelling revealed that these two countries exhibited similar data patterns. Results suggested that open-inquiry activities (such as debating and planning experiments) had a negative relationship with secondary students’ mathematical and scientific literacies. Structured inquiry learning (such as students explaining their ideas and teacher explaining how an idea can be applied to different phenomena) and epistemological beliefs about science were significant and positive predictors of student mathematical and scientific literacy performance.

Inviting teachers to explore computational approaches in STEM presents opportunities to examine shifting relationships to inquiry that support transdisciplinary learning in their classrooms. Similarly, play has long been acknowledged as activity that supports learners in taking risks, exploring the boundaries and configurations of existing structures, and imagining new possibilities. Yet, play is often overlooked as a crucial element of STEM learning, particularly for adolescents and adults. In this paper, we explore computational play as an activity that supports teachers’ transdisciplinary STEM learning. We build from an expansive notion of computational activity that involves jointly co-constructing and co-exploring rule-based systems in conversation with materials, collaborators, and communities to work towards jointly defined goals. We situate computation within STEM-rich making as a playful context for engaging in authentic, creative inquiry. Our research asks What are the characteristics of play and computation within computational play? And, in what ways does computational play contribute to teachers’ transdisciplinary learning? Results: Teachers from grades 3–12 participated in a professional learning program that centered playful explorations of materials and tools using computational approaches: making objects based on rules that produce emergent behaviors and iterating on those rules to observe the effects on how the materials behaved. Using a case study and descriptions of the characteristics of computational play, our results show how familiarity of materials and the context of play encouraged teachers to engage in transdisciplinary inquiry, to ask questions about how materials behave, and to renegotiate their own relationships to disciplinary learning as they reflected on their work. Conclusions: We argue computational play is a space of wonderment where iterative conversations with materials create opportunities for learners to author forms of transdisciplinary learning. Our results show how teachers and students can learn together in computational play, and we conclude this work can contribute to ongoing efforts in the design of professional and transdisciplinary learning environments focused on the intersections of materiality, play, and computation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

However, it is more known to represent students’ knowledge of system components and organization and less recognized as a tool to examine and enhance students’ understanding about the underlying causal mechanisms in complex systems. In this study, through a mixed method approach, we investigated the potential of CM in demonstrating undergraduate students’ (n = 173) ST. We also conducted a comparative analysis to examine the effects of different scaffolding on developing students’ ST skills. Through a theoretical framework of causal patterns, we present a new perspective on what CM reveals about students’ ST and what are its limitations in showing system complexities. The results indicated that CM can provide a platform for students to practice causal mechanisms such as domino, mutual, relational, and cyclic causalities, and accordingly, work as a tool for teachers to examine students’ knowledge of such mechanisms. The results also showed that students improved in demonstrating ST by CM when they were scaffolded for showing causal mechanisms and building CM. Eventually, this study concludes that the CM is a highly relevant tool to increase and examine students’ ST skills. To this end, we found it is important to explicitly teach students about causal patterns and guide them to construct CM with an emphasis on showing the interconnection among concepts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

From among those publications, our review is focused on the 27 that report the implementation of didactic interventions: 11 at specific special education centres and 16 at regular educational centres.

In this study, we investigate students’ ability to draw conclusions from measurement data and reasoning about measurement uncertainty in inquiry labs. This investigation centres around a task where students conclude whether measurements from two experiments that differ only by one setup agree or disagree. Surveys were administered in introductory physics courses before and after Workshop Physics instruction, which utilises an activity-based, guided-inquiry approach. Student reasoning was characterised using the point and set paradigms. Think-aloud interviews were conducted to gain deeper insights into students' interpretations of measurement uncertainty. The survey results showed that students tended to draw conclusions based on the means without appropriately accounting for uncertainty even if many recognised the need to evaluate uncertainty. The number of decimal places had no influence on students’ ability to draw conclusions. After instruction, students’ reasoning shifted from point toward set or mixed paradigm, but their ability to draw conclusions did not improve. During the interviews, students demonstrated sophisticated interpretations about measurement uncertainty and data analysis strategies they used. Students recognised measurement uncertainty is inevitable and were able to identify possible sources of uncertainty.

The teaching of this skill at this early stage of education, however, is demanding, particularly in whole school classes in which it is difficult to adapt teaching to children’s individual needs. We examine whether a scaffold that is static yet tailored to the context, in which the teacher explicitly models the reasoning process, manages to meet students’ individual cognitive preconditions for learning this skill. Within an inquiry-based learning setting, N = 143 third-graders underwent either an experimental condition in which they received the explicit scaffold, or a control condition in which they did not receive this specific scaffold. Employing a latent transition analysis and a general additive model, it is examined how the additional scaffold interacted with students’ prior knowledge, inhibition ability, and logical reasoning judged by their own teachers. It is found that the additional scaffolds managed to meet the needs of students with little prior knowledge; under the control condition, students with little prior knowledge showed decreased learning achievement, whereas under the experimental condition, students with differing prior knowledge learned to comparable extent and on a higher level. The scaffolds also almost fully diminished a disadvantage for students with lower teacher-judged logical reasoning, and supported students with high inhibition ability in mastering the most difficult aspect of reasoning based on irrelevant evidence.

The mechanisms of this influence may benefit from elucidation. Here, we describe a case of a teacher enacting an inquiry-based learning unit (LU) as part of a school science enrichment programme. The teacher’s interactions with the LU appear to be influenced by her self-stated idea of giving students ‘freedom’. We track these influences through the course of the teacher’s planning, enactment, and reflection of the LU. Because of how ‘freedom’ guides her actions, we argue that it serves the function of a value. Furthermore, we contend that the teacher’s commitment to ‘freedom’ represents an exercise of her deliberative agency. This commitment to ‘freedom’ is supported by her interactions with her context, which include labelling of her preliminary ideas with the term ‘freedom’, being asked to choose between curriculum materials, reflective conversations with the researcher, and reframing the site of enactment. We also describe challenges that the teacher faces with respect to student guidance, resulting from her commitment to ‘freedom’.

Besides serving research purposes, CS projects provide participants opportunities for inquiry-based learning to promote their topic-specific knowledge and scientific reasoning skills. Previous research suggests that participants need scientific reasoning skills to engage in scientific activities and to learn from inquiry in CS projects. Participants' scientific reasoning skills, therefore, might enhance the resulting topic-specific knowledge at the end of a CS project. On the other hand, scientific reasoning skills themselves are a learning outcome of CS projects. Hence, they might play a double role in CS projects: as a learning outcome and as a prerequisite for acquiring knowledge. In the informal education context of CS, it has not yet been investigated whether scientific reasoning skills predict topic-specific knowledge or vice versa. To address this question, the research presented here used a cross-lagged panel design in two longitudinal field studies of a CS project on urban wildlife ecology (N = 144 participants). The results indicated that participants' scientific reasoning skills positively influenced their topic-specific knowledge at the end of the project, but not vice versa. Extending previous research on individual learning outcomes of CS projects, the results showed that inquiry-based learning in CS projects depends on certain prerequisites, such as participants' proficiency in scientific reasoning. We discuss the implications for future research on inquiry-based learning in CS projects and for further training of CS participants in acquiring scientific reasoning skills. © 2022 The Authors.

Two previous large scale international studies assessed the SI understandings of students entering middle school and secondary students at the end of their formal K-12 science education. The purpose of this international project was to use the VASI-E to collect data on what primary level students have learned about SI in their first few years of school. This study adds to previous research to bridge the landscape of SI understandings now with representation from primary, middle and high school samples. A total of 4,238 students from 35 countries/regions spanning six continents participated in the study. The results show that globally, primary students are not adequately informed about SI for their age group. However, when compared with the students in the previous international studies (grades seven and 12), the primary students' understandings were surprisingly closer to the levels of understanding of SI of the secondary school students than those in the seventh grade study. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Knowledge sharing refers to the process by which individuals transfer information and thereby spread innovative ideas within an organization. We use knowledge sharing as a lens for identifying factors that encourage productive teaching-related conversations between individuals, characterizing the context and content of these discussions, and understanding how peer interactions may shape instructional practices. In this study, we interview 19 science faculty using innovative teaching practices about the teaching-focused conversations they have with different discussion partners. Results: This qualitative study describes characteristics of the relationship between discussion partners, what they discuss with respect to teaching, the amount of help-seeking that occurs, and the perceived impacts of these conversations on their teaching. We highlight the role of office location and course overlap in bringing faculty together and characterize the range of topics they discuss, such as course delivery and teaching strategies. We note the tendency of faculty to seek out partners with relevant expertise and describe how faculty perceive their discussion partners to influence their instructional practices and personal affect. Finally, we elaborate on how these themes vary depending on the relationship between discussion partners. Conclusions: The knowledge sharing framework provides a useful lens for investigating how various factors affect faculty conversations around teaching. Building on this framework, our results lead us to propose two hypotheses for how to promote sharing teaching knowledge among faculty, thereby identifying productive directions for further systematic inquiry. In particular, we propose that productive teaching conversations might be cultivated by fostering collaborative teaching partnerships and developing departmental structures to facilitate sharing of teaching expertise. We further suggest that social network theories and other examinations of faculty behavior can be useful approaches for researching the mechanisms that drive teaching reform. © 2022, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

We use an extended episode from a small group to illustrate how, in an inquiry-based unit, measuring near the resolution limit of a sensor caused scaling issues in graphs. Qualitative videotape analysis focuses on both the students’ attempts to make sense of a perceived lack of variation in the collected data and the teacher's and classroom researchers’ misinterpretation of the students’ difficulties with graph interpretation. We suggest that these educators, though experienced, could have benefited from additional strategies to help them recognise and respond to graph interpretation issues introduced by digital representations of real-world data, and that the students could have benefited from explicit prompts to discuss the limitations of their equipment. We describe several implications for researchers, teachers, and curriculum developers interested in implementing inquiry-based biology investigations using sensor data. We argue that students should be supported to recognise that encountering unexpected results from their investigations and working to understand what these results have to say about the real world is an important and valid part of the practice of real science. © 2023 The Author(s).

Such applications of machine learning have shown their promise in replicating and scaling human-driven codes of students' work. Despite this promise, we and other scholars argue that machine learning has not yet achieved its transformational potential. We argue that this is because our field is currently lacking frameworks for supporting creative, principled, and critical endeavors to use machine learning in science education research. To offer considerations for science education researchers' use of ML, we present a framework, Distributing Epistemic Functions and Tasks (DEFT), that highlights the functions and tasks that pertain to generating knowledge that can be carried out by either trained researchers or machine learning algorithms. Such considerations are critical decisions that should occur alongside those about, for instance, the type of data or algorithm used. We apply this framework to two cases, one that exemplifies the cutting-edge use of machine learning in science education research and another that offers a wholly different means of using machine learning and human-driven inquiry together. We conclude with strategies for researchers to adopt machine learning and call for the field to rethink how we prepare science education researchers in an era of great advances in computational power and access to machine learning methods. © 2022 The Authors.

In terms of their attitudes toward bullying, most preservice teachers report they are concerned about bullying, but some still believe it to be a normal part of growing up. Preservice teachers tended to view different forms of bullying as more serious than others, with many considering physical bullying to be the most serious form.

Research has shown that active learning activities can increase student anxiety if students fear that they could be negatively evaluated by their peers. Error framing (i.e., to frame errors as natural and beneficial to learning) is proposed in the literature as a pedagogical tool to reduce student anxiety. However, little research empirically explores how an instructor can operationalize error framing and how error framing is perceived by undergraduate students. To bridge the gap in the literature, we conducted a two-stage study that involved science graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) and undergraduate students. In stage one, we introduced cold calling (i.e., calling on non-volunteering students) and error framing to 12 chemistry and 11 physics GTAs. Cold calling can increase student participation but may increase student anxiety. Error framing has the potential to mitigate student anxiety when paired with cold calling. GTAs were then tasked to rehearse cold calling paired with error framing in a mixed-reality classroom simulator. We identified GTA statements that aligned with the definition of error framing. In stage two, we selected a few example GTA error framing statements and interviewed 13 undergraduate students about their perception of those statements. Results: In the simulator, all the GTAs rehearsed cold calling multiple times while only a few GTAs made error framing statements. A thematic analysis of GTAs’ error framing statements identified ways of error indication (i.e., explicit and implicit) and framing (i.e., natural, beneficial, and positive acknowledgement). Undergraduate student interviews revealed specific framing and tone that are perceived as increasing or decreasing student comfort in participating in classroom discourse. Both undergraduate students and some GTAs expressed negative opinions toward responses that explicitly indicate student mistakes. Undergraduate students’ perspectives also suggest that error framing should be implemented differently depending on whether errors have already occurred. Conclusion: Error framing is challenging for science GTAs to implement. GTAs’ operationalizations of error framing in the simulator and undergraduate students’ perceptions contribute to defining and operationalizing error framing for instructional practice. To increase undergraduate student comfort in science classroom discourse, GTAs can use implicit error indication. In response to students’ incorrect answers, GTAs can positively frame students’ specific ideas rather than discussing broadly how errors are natural or beneficial. © 2023, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

This paper focuses on the experiences of academics engaging in such work, particularly in their roles as educators, by sharing two of the authors' experiences introducing equity, diversity, and inclusion initiatives in a first-year science course at a Canadian university. Using critical research methodologies like narrative inquiry and memory work, we look at three separate instances where complex personal, institutional and course attributes fostered, allowed, or hindered efforts to bring these initiatives into the classroom. We consider how problematic incidents and obstacles relating to the organization of content on equity, diversity, and inclusion in science cropped up during the process, how they were perceived and handled in the moment, as well as the authors' reflections, takeaways, and lessons learned from the experience. These stories suggest that efforts to center discussions about equity, diversity, and inclusion in undergraduate science classrooms can be unpredictable and complex, particularly at the day-to-day level; this is especially the case when handling subtler microaggressions rather than clear instances of discrimination or harassment. Our study points to the importance of creating a more permanent institutional memory for initiatives that outlive those who initiated and organized them, so that they become embedded within the culture of a course or department. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Participants were 2200 ten-year-old students, 358 teachers, and 65 principals from Finnish elementary schools that participated in the OECD Survey on Social and Emotional Skills. Multilevel analyses show that students endorsed more of a growth mindset in classrooms where teachers used guided inquiry and in schools that emphasized students' social-emotional development.

Both perspectives have sidelined the use of real material objects that are indispensable for scientists to construct arguments about the natural world. To address this gap, this article investigates how material objects are used to coordinate with our speech and actions to shape argumentation in secondary physical science. Drawing on actor-network theory, the article reframes argumentation as a chain of human-material interactions incorporating the role of physical things to construct evidence. Based on a collective case study comprising classroom video data generated from two grade nine science classrooms, the article examines how teachers and students used material objects to engage in argumentation related to qualitative analysis in chemistry and Newton's laws of motions in physics. The analysis reveals two major themes: (a) material inquiry as the framing of questions and statements about the behavior or property of the material world and (b) material transformation as the orchestration of material objects, embodied actions, and words to actively create evidence. This article concludes that both material inquiry and material transformation are essential prerequisites for scientific argumentation to take place, not only in research laboratories, but also in science classrooms. The contribution to the development of a future socio-material theory of scientific argumentation, which takes material agency and multimodal discourse into account, are also discussed. © 2022 The Author.

The professional development of teachers in inquiry science is one way to ensure that teachers are equipped with effective strategies to teach science, particularly in non-metropolitan schools where development opportunities may be limited, and students’ attitudes to science are typically less positive than in metropolitan schools. Consequently, this study measured the attitudes to science and science self-efficacy of 133 school students aged 10–15 years from six non-metropolitan schools in Queensland, Australia, and explored the association with teachers’ professional development in inquiry science. A survey instrument demonstrating good psychometric properties was derived to measure three components of students’ multidimensional attitudes to science: acceptance of an inquiry approach to science, enjoyment of science lessons and career-interest in science. Findings showed that students’ attitudes to science and science self-efficacy differed significantly among schools. Teachers’ implementation of inquiry pedagogy in these schools was also varied.

In this study, we seek to contextualize culturally sustaining teaching practices in integrated science and engineering middle school classrooms. In collaboration with Mrs. Johnson, a veteran science and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) middle school teacher from the Midwest, this study draws on culturally sustaining pedagogy to understand the experiences of Mrs. Johnson in teaching a diverse middle school. This study also brings sociotransformative constructivism into our conversation to situate Mrs. Johnson's positional identities, the ways in which she enacts her reflexivity, and power in considering how culturally sustaining classrooms are cultivated. Using a narrative inquiry and case study approach, we utilized narrative interviewing to generate stories in making meaning of Mrs. Johnson's lived experiences. We applied thematic narrative analysis to develop three narrative threads, highlighting Mrs. Johnson's intentionality nurturing space for students to cultivate multiple epistemologies and disrupting the status quo in science classrooms. Our study illuminates a complex narrative such as the intentionality of making multiple epistemologies explicit in learning science and engineering and the required racial reflexive work for cultivating a culturally sustaining and student-focused STEM classrooms. We also highlight challenges Mrs. Johnson faces as she integrates students' lived experiences and alternative ways of knowing and doing in science and STEM teaching. © 2023 The Authors.

In this study, we report and analyze a case of emergent learning about measurement and uncertainty, in which students in a Chinese elementary school science class explored and reconciled discrepancies in hypotheses by constructing and using measures and making inferences. Adopting a model-based view of measurement, we show that when allowed to take on emergent measurement uncertainty while inquiring into causes for phenomena, late elementary students with no prior experience can engage in sophisticated reasoning characterized by a variety of theoretical modeling practices. Developing and aligning models of the phenomenon, the measure and the measurement data supported students in constructing an intuitive solution to their discrepancies. Our analysis also identified (1) a pattern of thinking and some common assumptions students adopted in their modeling practice that were productive, and (2) contextual elements affording and constraining emergent learning on measurement and uncertainty. In our discussion, we reflect on the educational potential of adopting a model-based account of measurement and of treating measurement and uncertainty as integrated into investigative practice.

Numerous studies based on multinational large-scale education data show such student-centered instructional practice positively led to students' motivational beliefs but was negatively associated with science achievement. Current literature, however, drew such a conclusion based on the measures of instructional practice from students' perceptions, not teachers, despite teachers being the subject matter experts and actual implementers of classroom activities. Thus, this study examined the relationships between teacher-perceived instructional practice, science motivational beliefs, and science achievement. Specifically, this study investigated the predictive effects of instructional practices on aggregated student motivational beliefs (i.e., self-concept, utility value, and intrinsic value) and science achievement in the classroom context. Moreover, the study explored the contextual effects of student motivational beliefs on science achievement. We examined 3861 eighth graders' data nested within 168 science classrooms in the Korean portion of the latest Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study using multilevel structural equation modeling. The results showed that the inquiry-based instructional approach did not predict science achievement or motivational beliefs at the classroom level. On the other hand, student self-concept and utility value positively predicted individual achievement, while classroom-level utility value statistically predicted average classroom achievement. In other words, the significant effect of classroom-level utility value on achievement was beyond the effect of individual utility value. The unique contributions of the study lie in advancing the science education literature with a fresh reflection on such relationships by using a less examined data source (i.e., teacher perceptions), focusing on the classroom context (i.e., classroom-level science motivational beliefs and achievement), and situating in an underrepresented country (i.e., Korea) in the literature. The results shed light on the discrepancies in the effectiveness of instructional practice perceived by teachers versus students on desired educational outcomes in a learning context. This study also discusses the practical and methodological implications for instructional and motivational research. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

We examined (1) how the PLC, which was situated in a culturally and linguistically diverse school that experienced high teacher and administrator turnover, shifted their collective inquiry and instruction from focusing on students' reproduction of knowledge to supporting students' epistemic practices and (2) how researchers and coaches facilitated the shift. The participants' collective inquiry took place on 12 job-embedded professional development (PD) days where they collaborated to plan, implement, and reflect on lessons over 4 years. The PLC drew on Ambitious Science Teaching principles, practices, and tools. We collected and qualitatively analyzed video recordings of the participants' meetings and classroom teaching on the 12 PD days (96 h) and artifacts. We also conducted interviews with teachers and coaches. Data suggest that early in the project, the teachers focused on identifying and fixing students' misconceptions, but over time they came to focus on supporting students' epistemic practices—collaborative construction of evidence-based models and explanations. Facilitators—researchers and coaches—played two major sets of roles—challenging teachers' view of students as reproducers of knowledge and engaging in co-inquiry with teachers to identify and address problems of practice—that functioned complementary over the years and supported shifts in inquiry and instruction.

When considering the literature on internet inquiries, the family as an informal place of learning is of particular importance. Although some predictors within the family (e.g., structural factors) are widely researched, comprehensive results on the influence of parental involvement, especially parental instruction as a form of parental support during information-related internet activities, on different internet uses are still lacking. Therefore, the study investigates (1) the relationship of parental role construction, self-efficacy, internet skills, and parental instruction in information-related internet use perceived by parents and children and (2) the relationship of parental role construction, self-efficacy, internet skills, parental instruction, and children's internet uses at home (entertainment-related, practical and school-or-learning-related). The mediation effects of parental instruction were also tested. A paper-and-pencil questionnaire was answered by 361 German children and their parents.

Their implementation varies greatly (Kook et al, 2020), yet few empirical studies have examined the outcomes of these experiences for student learning. Research indicates that authentic scientific inquiry that focus on students' agency in investigations can contribute to students learning (e.g., Houseal, Abd-El-Khalick, and Destefano, 2014). However, teachers have been challenged with implementing inquiry-based investigations (e.g., Anderson, 2007; Harris & Rooks, 2010). As new science standards increase the demand for science investigations in classrooms that afford students opportunities to engage with science and engineering practices (SEPs; NGSS Lead States, 2013), research is needed to understand the role of teachers and how these experiences can contribute to student learning. In this article, we describe the results of a national study that included data from 21 middle school science fairs. Data included observations of 20 science fairs, pre and postscience fair assessment data from 343 sixth grade students, and interviews or focus groups with 131 students, 122 teachers, 16 administrators, and 29 science fair judges. These data enabled the exploration of features of science fairs, including opportunities for students to engage in SEPs and the teachers support for SEPs through the science fair investigations. Findings reveal that science fair implementation varies considerably across schools. HLM analysis indicates that teachers' support for critiquing practices, particularly when it included students' engagement in evaluating the work of their peers, are positively associated with students understandings of SEPs. Qualitative findings highlight the ways in which teachers structured students' experiences and supported their enactment of SEPs as they conducted their science fair investigations. © 2020 National Association for Research in Science Teaching","Article","Scopus"

This study compares ontological and self-monitoring scaffolds with an agent-based participatory simulation on mainly undergraduate students’ (N = 96) understanding of complex systems. Data sources included pretest and posttest assessments of complex systems concepts. Results revealed that students in the ontological condition significantly improved from pretest to posttest on their agent actions and processes-based causality understanding, while apparently decreasing their understanding in action effects. In addition, students in the ontological condition improved more from pre- to post-test than students in the self-monitoring condition in their understanding of order.

Based on their initial levels of teaching efficacy (low, medium, high) determined by the TSES, three participants within each group were interviewed to obtain detailed insights regarding their science teaching efficacy. Quantitative data analysis suggested that PSTs’ science teaching efficacy beliefs regarding student engagement, instructional strategies, and classroom management increased at the end of the course. Qualitative data analyses revealed that most PSTs expressed increased efficacy in sub-dimensions of teaching efficacy. Exceptional findings emerged delineating little or no efficacy change particularly in classroom management due to the discomfort with adapting to the inquiry-based laboratory method and lack of teaching practice in a real classroom environment.

We investigate how student agency may be enabled and constrained when school science learning happens simultaneously across multiple school contexts. Using a social practice theory lens, we examine how three third-grade students with a strong interest in science attempt to pursue their own interest-driven inquiries across the classroom, school garden, and science lab and how the culture and resources of those contexts may enable or constrain students' understanding and use of environmental science in their lives and communities, or environmental science agency (ESA). Drawing on observations, videos, and interview data, we found that the particular culture of the different science learning settings appeared to enable or constrain students' ESA. The classroom teacher allowed for narrow forms of participation in science practice, and both she and the students reinforced these norms, which seemed to constrain ESA across all three settings. The science teacher allowed for broader forms of student participation, which appeared to support student ESA in the science lab. Students drew on flexible activity structures as well as access to scientific tools, living organisms, and citizen science resources to take actions to pursue their own inquiries.

We conceptualize the students' engagement as participating in a particular figured world, which is distinct from the figured world of authentic scientific inquiry. Using fine-grained discourse analysis of mentor–mentee interactions in authentic working sessions, complemented by interviews and other ethnographic accounts, we: (a) characterize this figured world; (b) identify central legitimate forms of participation that were enacted by the students and influenced their learning; (c) articulate how these forms of participation were socially communicated, constructed, and enforced over time in the interaction between the two students and the educational staff; and (d) examine how these forms of participation facilitated (or impaired) the learning of content and practices of the related physics. Two legitimate forms of participation, which contributed extensively to the EMBI's goal of creating a working artifact, are discussed in detail. The analysis articulates the social construction of these forms of participation and shows that (a) participating as an engineer facilitated many foundational aspects of learning of physics, (b) participating as a technician fostered a sense of agency and efficacy with regard to physics in a student who did not find ways to express himself in the regular physics classroom; however, it did not facilitate the learning of scientific content and practices. The implications for the instruction of physics in school, particularly given recent calls for integrated STEM education and Making in education, are discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

To tackle this challenge from the initial teacher education level, an innovative inquiry-based intervention contextualised in the scientific controversy of spontaneous generation has been developed and evaluated by involving pre-service teachers. Results from a pretest/posttest-control group design showed improvements in the understanding of the epistemological and sociological aspects after the intervention. The effect size detected in the experimental group versus the control group was retained and even enhanced five-and-a-half months after its completion. These results are especially relevant to respond to experts’ claims about the need for further studies to understand the issues related to retention following explicit instructions about NOS. Additionally, qualitative data provided an enriched picture of the participants’ understanding of the NOS, unveiling the complexities of the different issues involved and suggesting the need to combine quantitative and qualitative studies. Finally, implications for teacher educators and educational researchers are presented along with directions for future work in the field. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study elaborates an emergent temporal mechanism for engaging students' epistemic agency: “reflective structuration” by which members of a classroom community coconstruct ever-evolving inquiry directions and group structures as their collective inquiry work proceeds. Using an interactional ethnography method, we examined how students (n = 22) in a Grade 5 classroom coconstructed shared inquiry directions and flexible group structures to guide their sustained inquiry about human body systems over 7 months supported by a collaborative online environment. Rich data were collected to trace the work of the eye inquiry group as a telling case. With their teacher's support, students took agentic moves to construct an evolving set of wondering areas as a way to frame what their whole class needed to investigate. Flexible groups, such as the eye inquiry group, emerged and evolved in the various areas, leading to progressively deepening inquiry and extensive idea exchanges among students.

However, one of the challenges that students face is that they need to think and act like scientists so as to be sensitively alert to methodological flaws and various sources of error. This study thus compared the effect of two instructional approaches using a virtual lab to enhance students’ scientific literacy. Before students were given the opportunity to conduct science inquiries with the virtual lab, they were required to critique problematic inquiry cases (the critique group) or watch teachers’ demonstrations (the teacher demonstration group) before taking part in the inquiry. By analyzing data from 50 middle school students, this study found that the effect of applying virtual labs can be augmented by an instructional design that engages students in critiquing experiments prior to their inquiry with the virtual lab. This study also found a limitation of the use of virtual labs in helping students transfer what they have learned from the teacher’s demonstration to new inquiry contexts. A close relation among scientific literacy post-test scores, critiquing performance, and inquiry performance in the inquiry activity was detected, suggesting that student critiquing prior to inquiry is in alignment with the goal of developing students’ inquiry skills and scientific literacy with virtual labs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

One particular education research context is in the design of online environments that can support guided inquiry-based learning in the absence of the teacher. Specifically, how embedded pedagogy facilitates students' interactions with the online learning content and influences their engagement and approaches to learning. This study investigates the nature of student interactions with learning content in an online, guided inquiry-based, self-directed learning environment to explore their approaches to learning. Students interacted with scaffolded guided-inquiry online modules designed through application of a predict-observe-explain-evaluate framework. Quantitative data (engagement measures) were collected through digital artifacts and qualitative data (student reflections and activity) through interviews and student written responses. A diversity in learning approaches was observed as a result of individual learners' differences in their prior online experiences and existing chemistry knowledge. Learners’ individual differences also influenced student engagement in terms of persistence, systematic investigation and understanding of the science concepts.

Science education in schools has emphasized the development of science inquiry and problem-solving skills with the support of technology, and paid insufficient attention to creative thinking skills for producing innovative ideas or solutions. This paper presents an exploratory study aiming to investigate how secondary school students engage in scientific creativity tasks with the support of technology, in particular how they generate ideas in small groups via applying relevant thinking strategies, engaging in social communication, and constructing a computer-based mind map to facilitate group thinking. The participants were 24 Grade 11 students from a high school, who worked on a set of scientific creativity tasks in 6 groups. Epistemic network analysis of group conversations reveals that constructing a mind map helped students to retain ideas for elaboration and evaluation, stimulate new threads of discussion, and regulate task progression. Compared to low-performing groups, high-performing groups engaged more in divergent thinking, mind mapping, and regulative discussions, in addition to making these activities more closely connected with idea generation. These findings have implications for the design of technology-supported educational interventions intended to promote and improve group creativity in science education. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

However, the CoP model entails at least three limitations and challenges for teacher learning: novice teachers can seldom act as legitimate peripheral participants since they are obliged to do the same work that veterans do; veterans' learning is neglected since they are expected to teach the novices; and power dynamics between veterans and novices may constrain the group's reflective inquiry and, consequently, its learning. In this case-study, we explore the dynamics between veteran and novice science teachers in a purposefully sampled case of three teachers engaged in collaborative planning in a professional development community. We examine the implications of these dynamics for the group's reflective inquiry, using linguistic ethnographic micro-analytic methods to analyze audio- and video-recordings of the planning session. The findings demonstrate how in a collaborative planning context, legitimate peripheral participation is afforded, thereby mitigating face threats and supporting learning for both novice and veteran teachers.

In this work, we set out to examine whether and how engaging teachers as learners in doing science may support responsive instructional practices. We draw on data from a year-long blended-online science professional development (PD) program that began with an emphasis on teachers' doing science and progressed to supporting their attention to their students' doing science. By analyzing videos from teachers' classrooms collected throughout the PD, we found that teachers became more stable in attending and responding to their students' thinking. In this article, we present evidence from teachers' reflections that this stability was supported by the teachers' intellectual and emotional experiences as learners. Specifically, we argue that engaging in extended scientific inquiry provided a basis for the teachers having epistemic empathy for their students—their tuning into and appreciating their students' intellectual and emotional experiences in science, which in turn supported teachers' responsiveness in the classroom. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Article","Scopus"

As part of a broader design research study that used Structure-Behavior-Function (SBF) theory as an organizing conceptual representation, we created two instructional units that focused on pond and aquarium environments. We coded and analyzed 70 middle school students' drawings of aquatic environments collected before, during, and after a technology-rich instructional intervention. Coding considered several relations between multiple system levels: Macro-Micro (MM), Biotic-Abiotic (BA), and SBF. Hierarchical Linear Modeling analysis was used to examine the relationship within and between levels. This suggested that students followed multidimensional trajectories toward an increasingly coherent understanding of aquatic ecosystems (i.e., separately across the MM, BA, and SBF dimensions). Even so, the ability to observe phenomena at multiple MM and BA levels may be an underlying constraint to observing integrated SBF relations and the development of a more coherent understanding of ecosystems.

Following the workshops, small group semi-structured interviews were conducted to obtain deeper insight into how participants perceived systems thinking in relation to their teaching and research practice. Inductive analysis identified five major themes shared across both cohorts, relating to the perceived affordances and challenges of implementing systems thinking in chemistry education.

More specifically, we studied field trips in a natural environment by undertaking a French curriculum analysis and surveying teachers. We examined the responses of 511 teachers about their practices and motivations, as well as the levers and barriers to implementing these field trips. Results showed that this practice is widespread at all years of education, and differences between years seem to be related to the curriculum. We found few differences in learning motivations (reasons/objectives and interests/specific feature) and perceived barriers between different school teachers. Indeed, the teachers’ motivations are essentially scientific and rooted in a scientific inquiry approach. Studying ‘on real’ was the interest most often cited by teachers, essentially for the purpose of scientific learning. The only notable difference we found concerns the levers for implementing the field trips: a larger proportion of kindergarten and primary-school teachers see field trips as an ideal support for environmental and sustainable development educations. These results are dependant of the French official curriculum which plays a key role in influencing the current implementation of school-organised field trips by the teachers. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Nevertheless, there is little effort to synthesise these studies. Reviewing the status of research on STL, including the trends, approaches, and findings is crucial for identifying research gaps that require greater attention. Consequently, this review synthesises empirical studies investigating STL using TIMSS and PISA. First, we mapped their characteristics based on the aims, data, STL measures, and research approaches. Second, patterns of the findings were summarized by focusing on the (1) relationships between STL and student outcomes; (2) factors that explain STL variation; and (3) patterns of STL. Most studies examined STL related to inquiry activities and their relationships to student outcomes. Their findings were largely inconsistent and could be traced back to different ways STL was conceptualized and measured. This review calls for the studies examining TIMSS and PISA data to enhance the quality of research approaches and clarity in reporting them. It also encourages researchers to reflect upon the knowledge gained from harnessing these data to examine STL and discusses the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead. © 2022 The Author(s).

However, due to dynamic complexity across the timeline of inquiry learning, principles for designing tailored guidance are elusive. In this study, experienced tutors provided just-in-time guidance to 11 learners. We analysed tutor-learner interactions to investigate how tutors adapted guidance. We found tutors provided five types of guidance: prompts, support for domain knowledge, assessments, hints, and feedback. Guidance was provided when learners made errors, expressed difficulties, or asked questions; or when the tutor judged a learner successfully demonstrated a skill and was ready to progress to a follow-on skill.

Although there exists a body of research on mobile apps used for IBL in science education, limited attention has been paid to linking apps' features with their pedagogical affordances. Our study addresses this research gap by evaluating science mobile learning apps with respect to IBL pedagogy. Nine functional features of apps that support educational aspects of inquiry-based pedagogy are identified from user reviews, including: fingertip interaction, graphics visualisation, informative materials, location-based services, offline access, search by question, timeline scrolling, user tutorials, and zoom control. The information contained in the version history of the apps is analysed and four educational aspects of IBL supported by the nine functional features are identified as: motivation, conceptualisation, exploration, and conclusion. We have further compared the evolution of the functional features of apps to the educational aspects of inquiry-based pedagogy identified from different versions of apps. The findings of this study show the trend of updated functional features that support IBL and inform practitioners seeking to improve their use of mobile apps to support students' learning in science.

The particular focus on investigations and problem-solving provides opportunity for educators to embrace this. The primary curriculum explicitly values creativity in this regard, linking with inquiry, and problem-solving. In recent years, science outreach carried out by universities in the Republic of Ireland has played a significant role in the formal classroom as a support to primary science (KS1). This article explores the perceptions of these two educators in the primary classroom, teachers (N = 31), and science outreach practitioners (N = 30), with respect to their theoretical stance on the construct of creativity and secondly their application of creativity in practice. The interview method used engaged research participants in a dialectical analysis of conceptual and pedagogical dilemmas. This unique, primarily qualitative methodology, provides evidence to differentiate perspectives of these two groups. Results indicate that participants generate new understandings by engaging in dialectical reflection and critical analysis of the two binaries. They also reveal that although outreach practitioners and teachers align in their perception of the theoretical model, that outreach practitioners are more favourable towards promoting a more creative environment for science in practice. © 2021 The Authors.

Despite the research that highlights the role of teacher's instructional practices in enacting computer tools, few studies have considered teachers' use of computer modeling and its implications for student learning in classroom interactions, compared to interactions without computer tools. In this study, we examine (a) the impact of computer modeling on students' understanding of causal links in decomposition and (b) classroom interactions with use of computer modeling. We employed a quasi-experimental design with eight middle school science classes that served predominately Latinx students. The random treatment was at the class level (computer modeling; n = 60, four classes) and control (paper modeling; n = 59, four classes). Analyses incorporated student preassessment and postassessment, classroom observations, and audio-recorded modeling instruction. Results indicate that compared to paper modeling, computer modeling enriched systems thinking, particularly students' ability to provide causally coherent statements in explaining scientific ideas and evidence. Enactment of computer modeling may be associated with a shift in classroom interactions to include more invitation for students' elaboration of causal systems. We discuss aspects of computer modeling that may foster systems thinking, with implications for the future design of tools and curricula. © 2020 National Association for Research in Science Teaching","Article","Scopus"

This latter objective is analysed in the present study. To this end, a category-descriptor instrument was designed for the learning-to-learn competence. This allowed the moments and actions to be analysed, as well as the prospective teachers’ cognitive and metacognitive strategies during the ExA. The participants were organised into small work groups, and the information analysed was drawn from the records of the ExA in the notebooks which those groups prepared. In general, the results are indicative of the positive effect of the proposed ExA on the development of cognitive and metacognitive strategies in the prospective teachers’ learning processes.

Three domains are explored: informal formative assessment occurring in classroom interactions; structured formative assessment when teachers or peers collect information at a planned time; ongoing evolution of teachers’ knowledge and practices. We analyse how classroom formative assessment practices develop alongside and support inquiry learning. We report on how STEM teachers might be supported in transforming their teaching practices and assessment methods in tandem. We focus on the role of classroom discussion to challenge students’ ideas and make explicit their reasoning. We highlight how interactions between teachers and students support students in being more active in the assessment process. Combining inquiry learning with adapted assessment practices requires teachers to make significant changes to their practices. They need to be aware of how students develop their learning. Such professional moves are complex because implementing formative and summative assessments in a complementary manner remains a challenge for teachers and researchers. We emphasise how the collaboration between researchers and teachers support teachers in making changes to their professional knowledge, beliefs, and classroom practices. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

This contribution aims at describing various tensions that arose during the mentorship of SQBI in this program through the lens of Engeström’s activity theory. Field observations and semi-structured interviews with a sample of teachers suggested that numerous obstacles hindered mentor-practitioner collaborations. We identified at least three mechanisms that contributed to the paucity of interactions that we interpreted as contradictions of the activity system: mentors sometimes suggested activities that fell outside of the boundaries of curricula or were too time-consuming for a given group of learners.

It is important to investigate how students think in inquiry contexts. Given the tacit nature of higher-order thinking, cognitive maps (e.g., concept maps, reasoning maps) have been used to externalize thinking and have shown promising effects in terms of improving inquiry task performance. However, few studies have analyzed student-constructed maps that reflect the thinking underpinning students’ inquiry task performance. This study aimed to address this gap. Sixty-nine 11th grade students worked in small groups to explain a fish die-off phenomenon in a virtual ecosystem and collaboratively constructed an integrative cognitive map to facilitate thinking during the task. The map comprised a concept map (representing conceptual thinking about relevant subject knowledge) and a reasoning map (representing the reasoning process). Regression analyses showed that the quality of the student-constructed maps, particularly the reasoning maps, was a significant predictor of inquiry task performance assessed based on students’ written explanations of the phenomenon. Although the quality of the concept maps was not a significant predictor of inquiry task performance, it did predict the quality of the reasoning maps. Student thinking reflected in concept mapping and that reflected in reasoning mapping play different roles in inquiry learning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

This qualitative design study explores conditions to address this problem in school science inquiry. Dutch students (N = 22, aged 14–15) repeatedly consider the quality of their work: in a conventional, guided inquiry approach; by evaluating their conclusion in terms of the contextual purpose of the investigation; as consumers of knowledge facing the (hypothetical) risk of applying the findings in the real world. By gauging students’ confidence in the inquiry’s trustworthiness, we established that, while each confrontation instigated some students to (re)consider the quality of their inquiry, the final stage had the greatest impact. Students came to see that finding trustworthy results is essential, requiring scientific standards. The scientific quality of their inquiries was described, weaknesses identified and compared with the improvements students themselves proposed for their inquiries. While the improvemens were expressed in non-specific terms these align with a scientific perspective. Students now wanted to find trustworthy answers by exploiting scientific standards. In enabling students to engage successfully in basic scientific inquiry, finding ways to establish students’ mental readiness for attending to the quality of their scientific claims, and of personalised scientific criteria for their assessment, is indispensable. © 2022 The Author(s).

This study integrates theories of situated learning, authentic science research, socioscientific issues, and interdisciplinary STEM education to construct a program for high school students. Drawn from Vygotsky and Dewey's philosophy of social constructivism, we developed a framework to incorporate situated learning, authentic science research, and socioscientific issues in fostering sustainable development competencies of systems thinking and problem-solving to provide opportunities for students to transition from newcomers to adaptive experts. Using qualitative methods, we explored the development of a systems thinking approach in problem-solving related to climate change and air pollution in fifty-seven international school students in Taiwan. We found patterns of (1) systems thinking application in innovative solutions, (2) understanding the practices of authentic science research, and (3) interconnections between science and society. The findings suggest the framework has relevance to high-value learning of systems thinking and for discussions of problem-solving in community contexts and future research directions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

However, the affordances of physical labs might support the learning of specific skills and competencies that are just as crucial for learning science. In this study, we examined students’ discussions as they worked on physical and virtual labs to better understand how they learned from each, and the kinds of learning that each type of lab supported. One hundred and fifteen 6th grade students from three science teachers’ classes participated in this study. We examined audio data from all available groups as they engaged in physical and virtual labs (n = 14 groups; physical, n = 8 groups; virtual, n = 6 groups). We found that students conducting physical labs engaged in a significantly higher proportion of talk related to setting up apparatus and taking measurements and calculating outputs. Students who performed virtual labs, on the other hand, engaged in significantly more discussions about making predictions and understanding patterns of relationships between variables, and interpreting science phenomena. While students in the Virtual condition engaged in discussions that were more focused on the relationships between science ideas, students in the Physical condition learned science practices related to planning and carrying out investigations that are equally valuable. Our findings suggest that learning from one experimental modality may complement and supplement the relative weaknesses of the other, indicating a need for strategically combining the two.

However, challenge alone does not support conceptual development. In this paper, we draw on complexity theory as a theoretical lens to explore how a primary teacher facilitated students’ conceptual change through repeated cycles of challenge and support to develop increasingly robust concepts. Data are drawn from a primary class as they were developing initial understandings of distribution, informal statistical inference and sampling variability in the process of solving an extended mathematical inquiry problem. Data included classroom video, researcher journal and student work samples. The findings suggest two benefits to guiding students through multiple iterations of challenge and guidance: the opportunity to provoke and guide richer mathematical concepts; and the opportunity to provide earlier exposure to advanced mathematical concepts. Building on this research, we argue for the value of multiple iterations of challenge-support phases to develop increasingly robust understanding over time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

This systematic literature review is guided by a complex systems framework to organize and synthesize empirical studies of science talk in urban classrooms across individual (student or teacher), collective (interpersonal), and contextual (sociocultural, historical) planes. Findings are discussed in relation to contemporary approaches that integrate theories and methodologies to account for the complex phenomena of science discourse, including interacting elements across levels as well as stable and changing patterns that influence students’ access to, and nature of, science talk in urban classrooms. Unresolved questions related to high-leverage, equitable, and sustainable discourse practices; future lines of inquiry that can benefit by drawing from diverse theoretical traditions and mixed methodological approaches; and practical implications for classroom-based strategies to support science discourse are also discussed. © 2021 AERA.","Article","Scopus"

Also, teachers often undergo transformations in their professional identities during education reforms. However, very few studies explore the connections between teacher emotions and their professional identities against the background of education reforms, especially in Asian contexts. There is an increasing emphasis on STEM as an education reform in China and the world, and a deep understanding of STEM teacher emotions and professional identities is necessary in the fast development of STEM education. This study examined how a STEM teacher emotionally constructed her professional identities under the STEM education reform. Methods: This is a 3-year longitudinal case study employing a narrative inquiry approach with one STEM teacher in China. Data collection included one in-depth, semi-structured interview, three conversations, personal emotional diaries, and correspondence records. A four-step data analysis was conducted. Results: Three major themes reflecting the participant’s emotional professional identities emerged, including “an interested but confused learner”, “an enthusiastic but nervous explorer”, and “an excited but unsatisfied mentor”. In the participant’s experiences as a learner, explorer, and mentor, positive and negative emotions were always intertwined. These helped construct and shape her professional identities and encouraged her to be the best STEM teacher that she could be. Conclusion: This study provides a series of vivid and dynamic pictures of a STEM teacher’s emotions and professional identities against the background of STEM education reform in China from a 3-year longitudinal perspective. It also indicates the personal, social, cultural, and contextual factors that could have strong effects on teachers’ emotional experiences and the construction of professional identities. Furthermore, this study reveals that three processes (i.e., the process of education changes, the process of creating new or multiple professional identities, and the generation process of teacher emotions) could be intertwined and developed together. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

Therefore, we proposed that board game design is a meaningful tool for engaging youth in understanding environmental issues. We reported findings from an educational board game design workshop based on real world issues for teens aged 13–17 years conducted at a large public library Makerspace. Using qualitative methods, we analysed the teens’ process of making one such game, Pollutaplop, to understand its merits and argued that board game design nurtured the development of tools for inquiry. In response to the recent surge of interest in creating tools for learning about natural systems, we found that designing board games in authentic contexts engaged youth in building models as well as systems thinking.

The purpose of this large-scale follow-up international project (i.e. 32 countries and regions, spanning six continents and including 3917 students for the high school sample) was to collect data on what exiting high school students have learned about NOSI. Additionally, the study investigated changes in 12th grade students’ NOSI understandings compared to seventh grade (i.e. 20 countries and regions) students’ understandings from a prior investigation [Lederman et al.

Although the affordances of group drawing have increasingly been emphasized in science education, few studies have investigated how drawing as a visual mode interacts with group discourse as a verbal mode as well as how that interaction facilitates the development of students' collective ideas. Informed by theories in classroom discourse and multimodality, this paper examines the interaction process between a verbal and visual mode of representation as groups of students engaged in collaborative drawing during guided science inquiry lessons. On the basis of the analysis of data from a science class that adopted group drawing, we found and documented a recurring pattern, Plan-Draw-Evaluate or PDE pattern, in how the interaction between the verbal and visual modes occurred during collaborative drawing. This PDE pattern consisted of a triad of moves that alternate between the two modes and fulfilled various discursive purposes, such as suggesting, requesting, recording, visualizing, elaborating, agreeing, and rejecting. The PDE pattern provided a basic social structure that facilitated the collaboration and progression of students' ideas. With illustrations of PDE patterns and its variations, we argue that the PDE pattern provides an insight into the dynamic organization of interactions involved in group drawing that takes into consideration the multimodal affordances of verbal and visual modes of representation and the progression of ideas developed through collaborative discourse. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Article","Scopus"

In geosciences, training students to understand how science works does not only promote their interest and community engagement in the field, but also has the potential to promote awareness and ethics. However, instructional activities using an explicit and reflective approach to promote students’ learning of the nature of science concepts remain scant. In this paper, a two-class unit intervention using an explicit reflective approach to the teaching of nature of science was used in an undergraduate lesson on the history of plate tectonics. We measured the influence of the lesson on students’ nature of science knowledge using the Student Understanding of Science and Scientific Inquiry instrument. We collected parallel quantitative and qualitative pre- and post-intervention data from 37 community college students involved in a physical geology course. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis indicated that students’ nature of science knowledge related to the tentativeness of scientific theories and the role of society and culture in science improved after the intervention unit. Results imply that geoscience educators should consider using explicit and reflective approaches when using the history of science to teach about the nature of science. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

A total of 74 empirical articles out of the 201 obtained from the initial search with the keyword ‘5E model’ in the Web of Science (WoS) and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) databases were subjected to descriptive and content analysis. The outstanding conclusion from the synthesis of these empirical studies in which the 5E model was implemented is that the 5E model, which has had a broad impact for a long time, focused on its effects on sublevel thinking levels of Bloom's taxonomy (knowledge, understand), and its effects on higher-order thinking levels, which have a crucial place in science education, are overshadowed.

Research has indicated that modeling activities can advance students' understanding of a system's mechanism (i.e., systems thinking), such as an ecosystem. The current study examines the impacts of paper-based pictorial and computational modeling activities on students' systems thinking and CT skills. A total of 751 seventh-grade students were involved in online modeling activities, spanning over 4 days, and were assigned purposefully to a paper-based modeling condition (n = 374) or a computational modeling (n = 377) condition. They took systems-thinking-embedded food web and CT assessments before and after the four activities, in addition to a formative assessment after each activity. Multilevel modeling and repeated-measures correlation tests were used to analyze the students' quantitative data. Epistemic network analysis (ENA) was utilized to map out students' perceptions of what they believed they learned from the activities. The results revealed significant increases in the systems thinking-embedded food web constructs in both conditions. However, the increase of CT skills in the paper-based pictorial condition was not as significant as the increase in the computational modeling condition. ENA results showed that students in the computational modeling condition had more co-occurrences between science and computer science or CT concepts than those in the paper-based pictorial condition. These findings illuminate the benefit of engaging students in computationally rich science activities to advance both systems thinking and CT skills. © 2021 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

The purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry-based laboratory curriculum and to explore students’ performance by emphasising ‘expression and sharing’ during the planning of their investigations and argumentation. This ‘Scientific Inquiry and Practice’ curriculum lasted 60 h with 17 10th graders. We employed Science Writing Heuristics to help students integrate inquiry, argumentation, and writing practice into laboratory contexts. Data collected via a Multimedia-based Assessment of Scientiﬁc Inquiry Abilities, an Achievement Test, students’ writing in their Argumentation Writing Journal, and semi-structured interviews showed that some of the students’ scientiﬁc inquiry abilities, argumentation abilities, and content learning were improved after participating. Moreover, engaging students in the practice of ‘expression and sharing’ provided them with opportunities to develop competency in designing and evaluating the scientific inquiry, and scientifically interpreting data and evidence.

Awe, which is characterized in the literature as an emotion that facilitates learning and motivates an orientation toward something larger than the self, appears frequently in scientists' descriptions of their work. Empirical evidence also suggests that awe has a unique relationship with scientific reasoning. However, this evidence comes primarily from tightly controlled laboratory research, a methodology that limits our ability to investigate more authentic manifestations of awe and any lingering effects that may extend beyond the initial moment of experience. This study, a qualitative analysis of interviews with professional scientists (n = 30), advances our understanding of the conditions that are likely to elicit awe in the context of scientific practice as well as the perceived impact of those experiences. For study participants, the emotion of awe was deeply connected to the process of learning and to personal moments of discovery. Scientists described their awe experiences as contributing to shifts in their perspective or worldview, including a greater appreciation for the vastness and complexity of the universe. In addition, participants reported that awe served as an important source of motivation for their continued pursuit of the work. The findings indicate that authentic inquiry and metacognition, which we already recognize as critical pedagogical practices for encouraging scientific reasoning, are just as valuable for helping students to experience the affective dimensions of the discipline. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Article","Scopus"

High quality educative curricula contain features that help teachers customize learning opportunities and environments in ways that meet the needs of their learners. Designing these features requires expertise related to subject matter content, pedagogy, teacher and student learning, and instructional design. In other words, it requires interdisciplinary team work – which is notoriously challenging. To understand and support collaborative interdisciplinary design processes, a retrospective case study was conducted on interdisciplinary design team work that yielded a high quality educative curriculum for inquiry-based science learning. Design documents and transcripts of interviews with six designers (a cognitive psychologist, a practising physicist, and four science educators) were analyzed to identify their contributions during the phases of analysis, development, and evaluation to create educative features for developing pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Findings articulate specific educative features that can contribute to supporting PCK and thereby supporting instructional performance. Findings also reveal the proactive and reactive nature of designer contributions, describing different ways in which designers provide specialized inputs from a disciplinary perspective. Further, this study shows how designer contributions intermeshed, with contributions from one discipline shaping the work of colleagues, and thereby coordinating varied inputs to yield coherent educative materials. In addition, theoretical insights and recommendations for research on the nature of collaborative interdisciplinary design processes and implications for practice are given for supporting designers working in interdisciplinary teams to create educative curriculum materials for teacher (and student) learning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

The results suggest that introductory-level inquiry-based laboratory courses may not influence all students in the same way. By the end of the course, novice learners with a lower team-based problem-solving starting point reported greater learning growth than more experienced learners. As a result, the gap between novice learners' teamwork and problem-solving skills and attitudes and those of more experienced learners narrowed. However, the results also suggest that, by the end of the course, more experienced learners had developed negative attitudes to teamwork and problem-solving. In addition, deeper learning was found to be associated with improvements in team-based problem-solving for both novice and more experienced learners. Deep learning levels were related to both the magnitude and direction of attitude change, particularly for more experienced learners.

The students visited Nature Campus in groups of twenty. After each science day, the students worked in teams of 4–5 to make a poster, based on five pictures representing topics from the learning environment. This poster-making process served as a knowledge integration activity, aimed at assisting students in organizing all the knowledge from each science day, and integrating it with knowledge from the previous science days. Observations of students’ discussions while making their posters and video recordings of the activities throughout the science days were used as a basis for conclusions regarding which events in the program were recalled as meaningful by the students. The ideas and concepts that arose during the students’ poster making process demonstrated knowledge drawn from multiple activities in which they had engaged on Nature Campus, reflecting an understanding of evolution-related concepts from the fields of paleontology and ecology.

Open or authentic inquiry and undergraduate research are effective science experiences leading to multiple gains in student learning and development. Most inquiry-based learning activities, however, are implemented in laboratory classes and the majority of them are guided inquiries. Although course-based undergraduate research experiences have significantly expanded the reach of the traditional apprentice approach, it is still challenging to provide research experiences to nonmajors and in large introductory courses. We examined student learning through a web-based authentic inquiry project implemented in a high-enrollment introductory ecology course for over a decade. Results: Results from 10 years of student self-assessment of learning showed that the authentic inquiry experiences were consistently associated with significant gains in self-perception of interest and understanding and skills of the scientific process for all students—both majors and nonmajors, both lower- and upper-division students, both women and men, and both URM and non-URM students. Student performance in evaluating the quality of an inquiry report, before and after the inquiry project, also showed significant learning gains for all students. The authentic inquiry experiences proved highly effective for lower-division students, nonmajors, and women and URM students, whose learning gains were similar to or greater than those of their counterparts. The authentic inquiry experiences were particularly helpful to students who were less prepared with regard to the ability to evaluate a scientific report and narrowed the performance gap. Conclusions: These findings suggest that authentic inquiry experiences can serve as an effective approach for engaging students in high-enrollment, introductory science courses. They can facilitate development of science literacy and STEM skills of all students, skills that are critical to students’ personal and professional success and to informed engagement in civic life. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

However, there is an ongoing debate among practitioners about the nature, type, and level of such guidance. This study investigated the effects on middle school students’ (N = 116) conceptual knowledge and inquiry skills acquisition of providing two different levels of guidance (support or direct presentation of information related to the inquiry process) in hands-on and virtual science laboratories on the topic of electricity. The study was based on a 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial quasi-experimental design. The effects of two different levels of guidance combined with either a hands-on or a virtual laboratory were examined. Findings revealed that although the level of guidance was important for students’ conceptual knowledge development, it had no significant impact on their acquisition of inquiry skills. In terms of laboratory environments, it appears that a virtual laboratory and a hands-on laboratory are equally effective for the development of middle school students’ conceptual knowledge and inquiry skills. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

With this in mind, this study aimed to examine features of instructional videos for teaching scientific inquiry, a key element of science education, and learners’ engagement, a crucial issue in instruction in terms of representational strategies used. We analysed 16 instructional videos for science teaching generated by pre-service teachers. We found that the instructional videos tended to focus on posing a question related to a phenomenon and constructing its explanation conceptually rather than conducting investigations and interpreting the data. It was also found that there were alternations between providing relevant and conceptual resources and affording learners opportunities to answer questions verbally and visually to prompt their engagement. Various representational strategies, such as summarising, comparing, highlighting, sequencing, and presenting vivid phenomena, were also employed for better teaching scientific inquiry as a part of learners’ ongoing cognitive activities.

The research uses design-based methodology and deploys a pedagogical cycle based on representation construction and model-based reasoning, reflecting core disciplinary processes, and aimed at foundational concepts. The interdisciplinary structure of sequences in different topics, teacher pedagogy, and student reasoning and learning are illustrated through analysis of three learning sequence vignettes. In these topics both mathematical learning (measure, data modelling and spatial reasoning) and science learning (concepts and practices), were reinforced and enriched through the interdisciplinary framing. Drawing on notes of teacher planning and review meetings, coupled with classroom data, we identify (a) the conceptual and curricular design features through which mathematics and science can synergistically interweave, (b) the epistemological design challenges involved in working with teachers to achieve this interdisciplinary alignment, and (c) the key pedagogical design features that emerged to support this integration.

Student participants in this study were involved in discrepant demonstrations of scientific events and hands-on activities to introduce conceptual knowledge with the goal of motivating their learning interest in explaining phenomena scientifically. In addition, historical cases of scientific inquiry were utilised to scaffold and support inquiry procedures. At three time points during the semester, learning sheets were used to assess student performance in scientific inquiry practices (generating research questions and designing experiment). Results revealed that female students showed greater ability to form a research question than males. Additionally, while female science majors showed greater ability to generate a research design than female non-science majors, the opposite was true for males. Finally, the challenges and difficulties encountered by students in formulating research question and designing experiments are addressed. The findings of students’ significant and positive progress on formulating research question in the three consecutive assessments reveal the potential benefits of pedagogical approaches used in this study. On the other hand, the variety of students’ learning outcomes provide insight into potential ways that specific student subgroups may respond to pedagogies within an inquiry-based context. The initial findings also provide a starting point for instructors to begin debating the most productive ways of planning and delivering scientific inquiry instruction. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The sample comprised of secondary school students who used three different configurations of the HS: Fully structured, containing all words needed to formulate a hypothesis in the domain of the study; partially structured, containing some words; unstructured, containing no words. We used a design with two different measures of student ability to formulate hypotheses (targeted skill): A global, domain-independent measure, and a domain-specific measure. Students used the HS in an intervention context, and then, in a novel context, addressing a transfer task. The fully and partially structured versions of the HS improved the global measure of the targeted skill, while the unstructured version, and to a lesser extent, the partially structured version, favored student performance as assessed by the domain-specific measure. The partially structured solution revealed strengths for both measures of the targeted skill (global and domain-specific), which may be attributed to its resemblance to completion problems (partially worked examples). The unstructured version of the HS seems to have promoted schema construction for students who revealed an improvement of advanced cognitive processes (thinking critically and creatively).

The relevant skills associated with the design and interpretation of controlled experiments are summarised under the term control-of-variables strategy (CVS). Research on elementary school students’ CVS skills shows that they have basic conceptions of CVS, as they can correctly identify controlled experiments to test given hypotheses and can interpret the results of controlled experiments. However, they perform poorly when they have to plan experiments and interpret confounded experiments. Furthermore, previous research has identified eight misleading preconceptions regarding CVS that cause invalid experimental designs, called design errors. The current study investigates the occurrence and change of design errors during elementary school and their consistency over different tasks. Via a latent class analysis (LCA), we identified three distinct patterns of design errors: (1) correct CVS understanding, (2) change of too many variables and (3) non-contrastive experiments. Our results show that many students as low as grade two have a basic understanding of CVS and that occurring design errors are associated with limited metaconceptual knowledge about when and why to apply CVS. We discuss possible implications of our findings for teaching CVS and further research. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The purpose of this inquiry was to understand the perceptions of 34 high-school students about race and gender representation in STEM. Students participated in a 3-week, university-sponsored summer programme geared toward teaching and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). At the end of the programme, we interviewed students about STEM in their community, STEM role models, potentially working in a STEM field, barriers to STEM, and why they think White men are disproportionately represented in STEM fields. Guided by a critical framework with an intersectional lens, qualitative content analysis of interview data centered on the descriptive codes “race” and “gender” using a constant comparative analytic approach. Results indicated that participants (1) drew on family role models in STEM, (2) used White privilege and patriarchy at varying levels to explain exclusion from STEM, (3) described limited, stereotypical, and hidden depictions of race and gender in STEM, and (4) often perceived STEM as ""pushed"" while not explicitly associating STEM with helping, or giving back to their community. Implications drawn from participant perspectives call for educational endeavors that expand dominant conceptions of who and what is considered STEM, center students' families and communities, utilize a problem-based approach positioning STEM as a tool for social justice, and include direct conversations about gendered racism and stereotypes. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Article","Scopus"

Specifically, females are underrepresented in STEM industries. Identifying how male and female students deal with STEM learning challenges, and how this relates to learning outcomes, may inform teaching that best supports the preferences of individual students. This study asked secondary school students, who had just completed a STEM lesson that they reported as finding difficult (n = 3758; male = 51.2%), to write narratives about how they dealt with the lesson. Narratives were analyzed using a linguistic text analysis program to identify core psychological processes contained within the narratives from lessons in science n = 1305 (males = 46.3%), technology n = 589 (males = 63.7%), engineering n = 202 (males = 57.9%), and mathematics n = 1662 (males = 49.9%). Students were also asked to score how well they think they did in the difficult lesson (learning outcome). Pearson's correlations between students' use of core psychological processes and their perceptions of lesson success were computed separately for males and females. Common strategies emerged across the STEM subjects: for female students, positive learning outcomes were associated with positive emotions, social processes, rewards, and strategic thinking. For male students, positive learning outcomes were associated with motivation around the risk of failing, rationalizing the problem, and strategic thinking. Negative emotion was associated with a negative learning outcome for both broadly defined genders, but this was more evident across the subjects for females. We specify our understanding of this strategy by reporting data separately for the STEM subjects and the implications for STEM pedagogy. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Article","Scopus"

Prior work in this area has focused on students’ recognition of the processes occurring within a system. Comparatively, little work has been done on how students organise the objects that are contained within the system. Understanding how objects are organised within a system structure can promote understanding of the processes relating to the objects and advance students’ thinking about systems. A systematic literature review revealed different existing theoretical perspectives on object arrangement within systems. These perspectives were combined into a single framework, the Systems Object Framework (SOF), that can be used to characterise student ideas about object arrangements. The SOF was used to analyse object arrangements depicted by students in pre and post-concept maps that were collected as part of a study on a systems-based curriculum. This analysis provided support for the structure of the SOF and showed that the SOF allows for tracking of changes in students’ representation of object arrangements. The SOF contributes to the field by proposing new questions to be investigated and providing a common analytical tool that permits greater consistency across future studies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The purpose of this study was to identify changes in the students' personal constructs over time, in order to determine which aspects of what they had learned during the Science Days had been retained. I, therefore, conducted two sets of interviews, which employed Kelly's Repertory Grid technique to elicit “personal constructs” representing these students' perceptions of evolution and the concepts and ideas associated with it. The first round of interviews was held immediately after the program's conclusion, and the second was conducted 3 years later (ninth-grade). I then compared the results of the two sets of interviews. Our results showed that multiple elements of the Nature Campus learning experience were retained by the students, emphasizing the contribution of its characteristics as an authentic learning environment that uses visualization, tactile, physical examples, and interactive, inquiry-based activities to promote meaningful learning. They also showed changes in the prominence and complexity of certain constructs that reflect the nature of the relationship between what the students learned in the informal environment of the Nature Campus and what they have since been taught (or not been taught) in the formal environment of their school. © 2021 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Article","Scopus"

The current study explored choice-making timing patterns regarding STEM academic education in Israel. This research is based on a narrative inquiry into 55 in-depth interviews with parents of STEM students. The findings revealed four distinct timing patterns in educational choice-making: early choice (in secondary school); choice during military service, which is mandatory for both genders in Israel; late decision making, i.e. after ‘taking time’ for identity explorations; and ‘last minute’ choice, i.e. making a choice directly before or even after starting one’s academic education. Revealing these major timing patterns may enable Israeli educational policy makers to offer optimal intervention strategies precisely at the important turning points in the lives of young-adult learners.

Most of the studies were evaluative, seeking to establish the efficacy of VR Labs for meeting specific needs under the expectation that the mere use of them would bring about predetermined student outcomes. A phenomenographic investigation, which assumes that a person's perception is informed by their broader environment and results in multiple perspectives of the same phenomena was employed to investigate the various ways undergraduate chemistry students' experience learning with VR Labs. The inquiry is situated in an undergraduate chemistry course, where the VR Labs aligned with the course curriculum.

In this paper, we aim to synthesise relevant literature as the bases for proposing methodological practices to address these new research challenges. We draw on past and current pragmatist and semiotic perspectives to justify our methodological approach. We claim that research on aesthetic feelings needs to identify: (a) the complex nature of aesthetic meaning/feeling processes and multiple influences on these processes and (b) short-term and longer-term consequences on participants’ taste for, and learning in, science. Building on a practical epistemology, we propose that these questions can be addressed through multimodal analyses of aesthetic intentions and responses when embedded in teacher and student inquiry purposes, discursive interactions, artefact-making, and evaluative feelings/judgements. To illustrate the scope and challenges of these methodological strategies, we draw on examples of analyses in companion papers in this special issue, both when science is taught alone and when integrated with other subjects. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The purpose of this study was to understand how participation in a two-year induction programme influenced the extent of science process skills, inquiry, and PBL new science teachers enacted in their classrooms. This mixed-methods randomised controlled trial (RCT) included three cohorts of treatment teachers (n = 77) and control teachers (n = 52). Data sources included three observation cycles each consisting of 7 lesson descriptions and a videotaped observation each year for two years. Results indicated that more treatment than control teachers incorporated process skills in year one and inquiry and PBL in year two. Both treatment and control teachers implemented process skills and structured inquiry more often than other types of inquiry and PBL.

The goal of the present study was to consider the relative contributions of reading and writing ability on multiple-document integrative reading and writing tasks. Students in the U.S. (n = 94) completed two tasks in which they read text sets about a socioscientific issue, generated constructed responses while reading, and then composed integrated essays. They also completed individual difference measures (general knowledge, reading skill, reading strategy use) and wrote independent essays to assess their writing ability. Mixed effect models revealed that general knowledge and reading skills contributed to integrated essay performance, but that once general writing ability was entered into the model, it became the strongest predictor of integrated writing scores.

This study involves three years of design-based research as part of an educational project. We examine lower secondary school teachers’ qualitative Informal Formative assessment (IFA) practices during inquiry-based Science, Mathematics and Technology-Engineering (STEM) lessons. In-service teachers (N = 9) were filmed during a whole-classroom discussion session with respect to students’ alternative solutions or predictions in the context of problem-solving or investigating a natural phenomenon. The analysed discussions in the project’s third year lasted 15–30 minutes. The ESRU (Eliciting, Student response, Recognising and Using phases) model is adapted to analyse IFA practices, while also considering the role played by students. Inquiry dimensions (e.g. conceptual and epistemic) were used to examine the inquiries given priority in these discussions. The results show frequent (>30%) ESRU complete-cycle implementations by most teachers, which is associated with effective IFA practices. Frequent complete-cycle implementation led to teachers eliciting the same students at different moments of the session with longer consecutive cycles. The dimensions the teachers implement are more epistemic than conceptual. Moreover, students took charge of several ESRU phases. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

We draw on the work of Pierre Bourdieu and John Dewey in order to account for how teachers distinguish admirable practices and, in doing so, distinguish themselves as inspiring professionals. In order to illustrate this framework, we report a narrative inquiry on the life story of Tomas, a white man nationally prized for his science teaching. This inquiry was inspired by sociological portraits recommended by Bernard Lahire. Results indicate how a practical disposition (as opposed to a theoretical one) played an important role in developing Tomas’s individual taste for science teaching, producing a strong continuity between his early experiences as a masculine boy raised in a family of construction workers, on the one hand, and his later experiences as a biologist and a science teacher enacting inquiry-based activities.

For primary school students, there is no valid instrument for assessing the outcomes of their science inquiry. The aim of the current study was to develop a test for assessing science learning outcomes (analytical skills, planning skills, interpretation skills, and science knowledge) related to the five phases of inquiry-based learning (Orientation, Conceptualization, Investigation, Conclusion, and Discussion) at primary education level (ISCED 1). Results: A set of contextualized science tasks was created to assess each of the learning outcomes at three levels. The Science Inquiry Test for Primary Education (SIT-PE test) was developed through several phases, including pilot studies with large groups of fourth-grade students (10 to 11 years of age). The 1 PL Item Response Theory model was used to analyze the quality of the test and items based on the test’s reliability score, item difficulty measure, infit and outfit indices, estimation of item discrimination, item-scale correlation, and the quality of the scoring key. The final test, consisting of 24 items, was used with a sample of 1868 students. The analysis showed the SIT-PE test to be of good quality on test level and item level and to also have good predictive validity. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the correlated factors model and second-order factor model of the science learning outcomes both had a good fit to data collected with the SIT-PE test. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the multidimensionality of science learning outcomes and validated four dimensions of the model: analytical skills, planning skills, interpretation skills, and science knowledge. Conclusions: In conclusion, the SIT-PE test could be further used for assessing students’ inquiry competence in primary education. However, it could be even further improved in several ways and this study provides guidelines on how to do that. In addition, the SIT-PE provides test developers with information on how to design derivations of the SIT-PE test for assessing particular science inquiry outcomes or the same outcomes in older age groups as well. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

Geospatial Inquiry is defined as: asking and answering a research question through the analysis and communication of data that is linked to a geographic location on, above, or near Earth. These data are often represented visually via maps and explored with geospatial technologies. It also examined the relationships between Geospatial Inquiry Teacher Workshop (GITW) implementation and teacher implementation of the Geospatial Inquiry Cycle. Situated cognition provided a theoretical framework for the design, development, and implementation of the GITWs and lessons. Surveys, technology assessments, lessons, and artifacts were analysed using a-priori coding, descriptive statistics, and a generalised linear modelling approach that included hierarchical analysis. Results indicated teachers implemented Geospatial Inquiry lessons with integrity to the principles of Geospatial Inquiry and utilised research-based pedagogical practices. Format of GITWs (e.g. face-to-face or blended) resulted in differences during teachers’ lesson implementation. In addition, whether GITWs were delivered by an individual facilitator or a team of facilitators impacted teachers’ lessons.

A challenge is how to motivate and engage all learners in science, and not just those destined for science-related careers. This challenge becomes more acute in senior secondary high-stakes assessment contexts where science traditionally becomes discipline-based and optional. The New Zealand framework curriculum and modular credit-based secondary exit qualification introduces systems-level flexibilities that support the offering of learning choices that can take science on a track different to conventional discipline-based courses. This article reports on findings of an eight-month study involving three cycles of collaborative action research with a Year 12 science class. We describe and analyse students’ experiences when a teacher opened learning choices using different types of science inquiry in a new General Science course. Students were working on the New Zealand senior secondary exit qualification. Findings show how students can respond to different levels of choice to learn and achieve more on their own terms. While tensions and cautionary notes are floated, findings demonstrate how offering flexibility and choice to non-specialist science students can make science more accessible by responding to diverse learning motivations and interests. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

This study used episode-based analysis to identify both forms and functions of on-the-fly formative assessment conversations during all phases of the inquiry lessons. We video-recorded two teachers' physics lessons for 7th graders (13–14 years). When analysing the forms of on-the-fly formative assessment conversations, we found five types of collecting information, including questioning and other means, and four ways of using the information. We also studied the functions of on-the-fly formative assessment and found four main functions and their sub-functions. The main functions differed according to the purpose of guiding in relation to the flow of student inquiry. Teachers (1) checked or examined students’ thinking, (2) corrected or developed students’ present thinking, (3) redirected students’ thinking and (4) reviewed students’ thinking.

However, research has not yet focused on investigating whether students perceive those activities as authentic and whether students’ perceived authenticity is related to further motivational (e.g. situational interest) or cognitive (e.g. achievement) learning outcomes. An authentic learning activity that emulates scientific inquiry processes is Productive Failure (PF). In PF, students are asked to explore solutions to a complex problem before they have to falsify their solutions during instruction. The present study, which aims to replicate the findings of a previous study, investigates whether PF has an impact on students’ perceived authenticity and their situational interest in an OSL for social sciences. We further examined whether students’ perceived authenticity is associated with their situational interest and knowledge acquisition. For this purpose, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 152 10th graders and compared PF to Direct Instruction (DI). DI can be characterized as less authentic, as it promotes the conceptualization of scientific inquiry being nothing else but an application of instructions. The results mostly replicate the findings of the previous study, showing that the authenticity level of the learning activity did neither affect students’ perceived authenticity nor their situational interest. Furthermore, students’ perceived authenticity correlated with their situational interest but not with their knowledge acquisition.

To foster TCDSIL, its influencing factors and promotion strategies need to be studied. However, prior studies on TCDSIL mainly investigate the influencing factors from a single-level perspective and neglect the potential relationship of school context on TCDSIL. In order to fill this gap and provide a deeper understanding of the complex system of TCDSIL, this study surveyed 9909 teachers in 1286 primary and secondary schools and used a two-level hierarchical linear model to analyze the survey data. The analysis results indicated that both teacher characteristics and school context have a significant relationship with TCDSIL. Among school-related factors, school type, resources for instruction, and network bandwidth have positively significant relationships with TCDSIL. Moreover, teachers' perceived usefulness, information processing skills (the skills of information access, information usage, and information management), and information ethics could predict TCDSIL. This study provides implications regarding how to improve TCDSIL, including paying attention to the gap between primary school teachers and secondary school teachers; enriching school's digital teaching resources; ensuring school network quality; enhancing teachers' perceived usefulness of ICT, information processing skills, and information ethics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

Therefore, the establishment of a mechanism for information judgment and evaluation to promote primary schools' students digital reading skills and information literacy has become a more and more important research issue in recent years. This study thus developed a web-based inquiry learning mode with collaborative digital reading annotation system support (WILM-CDRASS) aiming to provide innovative teaching mode of effectively enhancing information evaluation abilities of primary schools' students. A quasi-experimental design was conducted in this study to examine the learning effectiveness and technology acceptance of using WILM-CDRASS to enhance information evaluation abilities of primary schools' students compared to a web-based inquiry learning mode with general discussion board support (WILM-GDBS). A total of 50 Grade 5 students from two classes of an elementary school in New Taipei City of Taiwan participated in a collaborative inquiry-based learning course, “Internet information judgment and evaluation,” in this study. A total of 25 students from a class was assigned as the experimental group using WILM-CDRASS to enhance their information evaluation abilities, and a total of 25 students from the remaining class was assigned as the control group using WILM-GDBS. The learning outcomes of WILM-CDRASS and WILM-GDBS in the learning effectiveness and technology acceptance were also compared between students with different prior knowledge levels and cognitive styles from both groups. The analytical results revealed that the learning effectiveness and technology acceptance of learners in the experimental group using WILM-CDRASS for an information literacy course are significantly superior to those of learners in the control group using WILM-GDBS. The research findings also showed that the use of WILM-CDRASS was more beneficial to the students with low prior knowledge and field-independent cognitive style than those of using WILM-GDBS. As for technology acceptance, students with low prior knowledge perceived the use of WILM-CDRASS more helpful than WILM-GDBS for their learning. Based on the research results, several suggestions for the implementation of WILM-CDRASS to support information literacy courses were proposed. Besides, it is suggested to investigate students' effective learning behaviors and the relationship between the learning behaviors and learning performance in inquiry-based information literacy courses with WILM-CDRASS support in future study. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

The data consist of essays, analysed through inductive and deductive content analysis. The findings show that although pre-service teachers present a multitude of ways to mitigate climate change, there is a divide in what is seen as the best practice and who is viewed as responsible. Furthermore, most pre-service teachers present a simplistic or biased view about who is responsible for mitigative actions. Only a small proportion of pre-service teachers seem to examine climate change mitigation through a systems thinking approach, where individuals, governments and businesses all play a role in climate change mitigation. Six profiles were formed to describe the different ways how individuals see responsibility in the context of climate change.

Science education should address this, including modelling practices about the aquifer model. Physical models (PM) have been extensively used in geology teaching, but students rarely construct, evaluate or manipulate them. This study addressed how the revision and manipulation of PMs contributed to the construction of a complete aquifer model by 80 Preservice Elementary Teachers (PETs) of two cohorts (subsequent years) that participated in a modelling teaching sequence that included fieldwork and the construction of a PM The model representations (drawings, writings, oral expressions, PMs) were analysed, based on systems thinking framework, through a constant comparison method. In Year 2 PETs that constructed a complete model tripled those of Year 1. The conversations in groups and the model representations throughout the sequence show that the evaluation of the PM when comparing it with reality during the field trip, and their manipulation guided by teacherś scaffoldings to encourage PETs to make representations and predictions, led them to revise their models in Year 2. Therefore, we conclude that it is the manipulation and revision of PMs that facilitates the revision and improvement of the aquifer model. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

To promote further use of RBISs, the propagation paradigm suggests that developers work with potential adopters during the development process, and provide ongoing support after adoption. This article investigates the impact of a faculty online learning community (FOLC) as a professional development mechanism for supporting faculty adopting a research-based curriculum. A FOLC uses video conference technology and online platforms to connect geographically dispersed faculty with similar backgrounds (e.g., physics faculty) and supports their teaching development. In the context of a specific FOLC, this article seeks to determine the outcomes the FOLC achieves, and how. Results: Analysis of a FOLC meeting identified opportunities for rich, complex social interaction centered on the research-based curriculum. By functioning as a sounding board for ideas, a space to share experiences, a source of affective support, and a venue for troubleshooting, the FOLC mediates the achievement of a range of outcomes related to implementation of the curriculum. Survey results indicate that members feel a sense of community in the FOLC and that it provides encouragement through teaching challenges. Further results indicate participants’ increased confidence in using the curriculum; familiarity with the curriculum structure and content; increased knowledge of pedagogical techniques; reflection on teaching practices in the curriculum; and use of pedagogical techniques aligned with the curriculum’s core principles. Emerging evidence supports more distal outcomes, including student learning, persistence in using the curriculum, reflection in teaching practice across courses taught, and use of research-based pedagogy in other courses. Conclusions: The propagation paradigm emphasizes the need for ongoing support for adopters of RBISs. The FOLC model provides participating faculty with ongoing support through participation in a community and is an effective support mechanism for adopters of a research-based curriculum. In this study, FOLC members are increasing their knowledge and use of pedagogical techniques in the curriculum-specific course and beyond. This is facilitated by the opportunities in the FOLC for troubleshooting, idea sharing, and receiving encouragement through challenges. This model has the potential to support adopters of additional educational innovations. © 2021, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

PCK is a specialized form of teacher professional knowledge widely considered a paramount construct of teacher quality. Thirty-six preservice science teachers' PCK levels were determined by analyzing their edTPA portfolios, including videos and written commentaries, with the PCK mapping approach, an enumerative analytical method capable of quantifying and visualizing the integration of PCK components. Data analysis indicates there was a significant positive correlation between participants' edTPA scores and their PCK levels (rs[36] = 0.949, p < 0.0001). Through further analysis, this study also identified several key features of preservice teachers' PCK revealed in their edTPA portfolios: (1) preservice science teachers' Knowledge of Student's Understanding (KSU) and Knowledge of Instructional Strategies and Representations (KISR) were the most developed components of PCK; (2) accounting for over 50% of all connections between PCK components, KSU, KISR, and Knowledge of Assessments were among the most frequently integrated components of PCK; (3) Knowledge of Science Curriculum was the least frequently integrated, and therefore the weakest, component of preservice teachers' PCK; and (4) inquiry was the most frequently mentioned, and typically the only Orientation toward Teaching Science found in participants' edTPA materials. This study contributes to the growing body of scholarship on the characteristics of preservice science teachers' PCK and becomes one of only a handful of empirical studies that examine the edTPA's diagnostic abilities. Finally, potential implications regarding the edTPA in science teacher education, as well as directions for future research surrounding preservice science teacher PCK and PCK development, are discussed. © 2020 National Association for Research in Science Teaching","Article","Scopus"

The sample consisted of 30 5th grade students, who were randomly divided into two groups: the implicit –T1 (N = 14) and the explicit –T2 (N = 16). Instruction followed an inquiry model, lasting fourteen (14) hours for each group. T2 was taught the non-linear nature of inquiry explicitly, in contrast to T1, which was expected to acquire such understanding without direct instruction regarding NOSI. A written questionnaire in conjunction with individual semi-structured interviews was used to assess students’ views before and after instruction. Content analysis was conducted with the data from the written questionnaire and the interview transcripts. The pre-test showed that students seem to argue over the alternative view on the linear nature of the inquiry procedure. The post-test results support that epistemic understanding of the explicit group were significantly improved towards more informed levels in contrast to the implicit group, whose epistemic understandings appeared not to change or in some cases fell to a lower level. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The paper aims to unravel some of the complexity that underpins classroom assessment practices as teachers bring change to their pedagogical approaches, taking into consideration both the variability and variation in interpretation of both processes by STEM teachers across eight countries. By engaging with research processes, in collaborative working groups in each country, teachers were better equipped to face the practical challenges they encountered in their various contexts, strengthening both their processes of critical reasoning and exercise of professional judgement. We draw from this interweaving of connected professional ideas and nested practices, a consideration of those factors which seem most pertinent in terms of formality, temporality, response and desired outcomes. As such, the paper provides a directive that highlights how the development of inquiry competences and the skills to negotiate productive pathways through an inquiry activity can be informed, developed and enhanced by formative assessment.

We conducted a qualitative content analysis of 2,927 tasks from three Year-11 textbooks. The results showed that most of the tasks in all three textbooks were closed and asked the pupils to reproduce facts from the textbook or other information sources. However, findings also indicated that there are differences between and within the different chapters of the textbooks. In the topics that include socio-scientific issues, the tasks are more open for the pupils to both explore and evaluate evidence. Furthermore, all the three books have an introductory chapter focusing on scientific methodology, and the tasks in this chapter are much more diverse than in the remaining chapters.

Research has shown that these programs can provide a variety of benefits for the programs’ recipients, including increased academic achievement, satisfaction, retention, and entry into STEM careers. This paper extends this line of inquiry to investigate how participation in these programs impacts the undergraduate STEM students that provide the mentoring (defined here as undergraduate mentor-teachers or UMTs). We use activity theory to explore the nature of metacognition and identity development in UMTs engaged in two programs at a public urban-serving university in the western USA: a STEM Learning Assistant program and a program to organize middle and high school STEM clubs. Constructs of metacognition and identity development are seen as critical outcomes of experiential STEM inreach and outreach programs. Results: Written reflections were collected throughout implementation of two experiential STEM inreach and outreach programs. A thematic analysis of the reflections revealed UMTs using metacognitive strategies including content reflection and reinforcement and goal setting for themselves and the students they were supporting. Participants also showed metacognitive awareness of the barriers and challenges related to their role in the program. In addition to these metacognitive processes, the UMTs developed their science identities by attaching different meanings to their role as a mentor in their respective programs and setting performance expectations for their roles. Performance expectations were contingent on pedagogical skills and the amount and type of content knowledge needed to effectively address student needs. The ability to meet students’ needs served to validate and verify UMTs’ role in the program, and ultimately their own science identities. Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that metacognitive and identity developments are outcomes shaped not only by undergraduate students’ experiences, but also by their perceptions of what it means to learn and teach STEM.

To achieve this type of classroom environment, teachers should attend to students' knowledge and ideas and pay attention to how students are located within teacher-led interactions, such as being positioned as active discussants or designated listeners. In this study, we explore if and how this is occurring in the NGSS era. We used a naturalistic inquiry to explore how an experienced first-grade teacher used a new NGSS-aligned unit that called for students to use the science and engineering practices (SEP) to build content knowledge. We used a macro-analytic lens to answer the research question “how are class discussions shaped to address the SEP”? We used a micro-analytic lens to answer the research question “how are students positioned during these science discussions in this classroom?” Evidence suggests that the teachers' whole class discussions incorporated and involved the SEP which were specified in the unit lessons for content learning. However, on a micro-analytic level, we found that few students were positioned as active discussants. The teacher heavily relied on those students who could provide succinct and clearly relevant answers while positioning the remainder of the students as silent spectators. Implications from this research suggest that not only new NGSS curriculum materials need to focus on what students should know and do but they also need to address heuristics for teachers that show them how to position all of their students as active doers of science so all students have opportunities to build deeper, core science knowledge. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Within science classrooms, group work may mirror modern scientific research: successful interaction among team members (social/relational) that engages probing questioning and creativity (cognitive/content) with emotional attachment to their work (affective). Previous research on small group work in school science focused either on single dimensions of group work—mostly on needed cognitive resources, e.g., knowledge and skills for understanding and addressing the problem—or on the interplay between cognitive and social resources (e.g., science knowledge and capacity to foster group interactions), while the role of affects is relatively unexplored. We propose that group work demands the collective construction of a “triple problem solving space” in which all three dimensions—cognitive/content (the problem to be solved), social/relational (the challenges based on social interactions within the group), and affective (the emotional life of the group)—are developed on a moment-by-moment basis. Assessing whether and to what extent students collectively construct a positive triple problem solving space, we videotaped small groups’ interactions (3–4 students per group) during inquiry-based activities in three ninth grade science classes. Results showed that when a group collectively positions itself positively in terms of social and affective dynamics, it tends to engage effectively in the cognitive aspects of the assigned tasks. The qualitative analysis further highlights the socially-shared regulation processes that involve an ongoing negotiation between intra- and inter-individual resources and which are the result of each group member deploying individual resources along each dimension, monitoring and evaluating their peers’ processes, and adjusting their processes accordingly through integration of information from self and others. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

Unfortunately, classroom environments have not generally evolved to support students in the new modes of collaboration, idea sharing, and inquiry that characterize many of our research-based innovations. Responding to this challenge, our research was conducted by a multi-disciplinary design team including educational researchers, a high school physics teacher, and technology designers. We embarked on a series of design-based research projects to investigate a smart classroom infrastructure that scaffolds students and teachers in new forms of collaboration and inquiry, including a substantive role for large projected displays and small touch surfaces, as well as a dependency on students’ physical location within the room. This paper describes our designs, including: (1) the role of large displays for communicating aggregate and ambient information, (2) the role of real-time communication between students, (3) the application of intelligent software agents to enact real-time pedagogical logic, (4) support for learning across contexts, and (5) orchestration of inquiry roles, materials and environments. These designs are particularly relevant for the Learning Sciences community, as they offer insight into how the orchestrated classroom can support new forms of collaborative, cooperative and collective inquiry. One important outcome of this work is a set of design principles for supporting smart classroom research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Scopus"

However, little has been discussed on how to design and use tasks enhancing students’ NOS understanding. In an attempt to fill this gap, we analysed the way NOS tasks are used in seven textbooks for a new subject ‘scientific inquiry and experimentation’ in Korea. The analysis of 84 tasks led to three categories being identified: guiding to NOS ideas, expanding NOS understanding and thinking critically about NOS. Whereas the majority of the textbook tasks were used as guides to declarative NOS ideas, few tasks invited students to think critically about controversial aspects of NOS. Most tasks were pointed at the epistemic aspects related to scientific methods or knowledge, while the social aspects of science were seldom addressed. Besides, the number and diversity of NOS tasks varied significantly across different publishers. Based on these findings, we call for more strategic and systemic use of NOS tasks in science textbooks, including the use of diverse tasks in proper manners and sequences, as a crucial step to successful NOS instruction in schools. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Inquiry-based instruction is often combined with guidance attempting to assist students to effectively engage in inquiry activities and, through this engagement, reach the intended goals. In recent research, the type and amount of guidance needed to foster student’s learninghas received considerable attention. One challenge in interpreting the results of this line of research is the manifold meanings of the term ‘guidance’ and its implementation in inquiry-based instruction. Moreover, the effectiveness of a particular type and amount of guidance may also depend on the learning goal that is to be achieved. In this paper, we draw on existing research and theoretical considerations in attempting to disentangle three major dimensions in which the implementation of guidance may vary: (a) the degree of autonomy, (b) the degree of conceptual information, and (c) the cognitive domain of guidance. We discuss how these dimensions can be used to capture and systemise fidings of existing studies as well as to infer desiderata for further research on the role of guidance in inquiry-based instruction. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Specifically, we worked with three first-grade classrooms assigned to one of three conditions—instruction through use of a first-person perspective only, third-person perspective only, and integrated instruction—to engage ideas of complex systems thinking. In each condition, systems concepts were targeted through instruction and assessment. The integrated and third-person classrooms demonstrated significant gains while the first-person classroom showed gains that were not statistically significant, suggesting that third-person perspectives play a critical role in how children learn systems thinking.

Although empirical evidence shows that inquiry-based learning requires instruction, research comes from two approaches that have not been bridged yet: direct instruction of scientific reasoning and teacher training of verbal support. We investigated how these two types of instruction separately or combined strengthened children’s scientific thinking by comparing four conditions: baseline, direct instruction, verbal support, and a combined approach. Effectiveness of an inquiry-based lesson series on scientific reasoning abilities, vocabulary, and domain-specific knowledge (near and far transfer) were studied among 301 fourth graders. Results showed that both approaches strengthened different components of scientific reasoning abilities, and that a combination of instructions was most effective for scientific reasoning abilities, vocabulary, and domain-specific knowledge. Domain-specific knowledge acquisition was strengthened only when both instructions were provided. It can thus be concluded that each type of instruction has unique contributions to children’s science learning and that these instructions complement each other. Our study thus showed that inquiry-based lesson series when preceded by direct instruction of scientific reasoning and scaffolded with verbal support are most effective. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The qualitative analysis identifies four meanings of ‘experiment’ in these various documents: (1) subject content, (2) pedagogy, (3) scientific processes, and (4) inquiry. The quantitative analysis shows that the frequency of two meanings of ‘experiment’, subject content and pedagogy, has decreased while two other ones, scientific processes and inquiry, has experienced an upward trend during the period under study. While analysing five typical ICCs in different decades, it was found that the distribution of the four meanings of ‘experiment’ in these ICC documents has become more balanced from the past to the present.

The purpose of this study is to explore how four dimensions of engagement (i.e., cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and social) were driven by inquiry-related curiosity and how they affected the students’ inquiry abilities. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze data collected from 605 11th graders, including their responses to items in an online questionnaire and their performances on a computer-based assessment of scientific inquiry abilities. The results showed that students’ curiosity was associated with their inquiry abilities, and such an association was partially mediated by the four dimensions of engagement in science laboratory classes. Moreover, the results revealed that among the four dimensions of engagement, only cognitive and emotional engagement had significant total effects on students’ inquiry abilities and that the influence of behavioral and social engagement on inquiry abilities was completely mediated by cognitive engagement.

This study used the sociocultural concept of marginal non-participation to describe interactional moves learners use to navigate status hierarchies in an inquiry science context where student authority may permit learners to obstruct peers’ participation. Participants were three collaborative groups of 3–4 learners in 7th grade science classrooms where a series of inquiry curriculum units were being implemented. Interviews were used alongside a microgenetic analysis of video-recorded group work observations to identify interactions that legitimated and delegitimated status hierarchies. Legitimation involved communicating acceptance of differential belonging and competence while delegitimation involved challenging differential reward by fostering widespread participation. Low- and high-status group members were active in both processes.

The present study, however, explores how in-service secondary education Greek biology teachers address the topic of ‘ecosystem delimitation’ under the assumption that the ecosystem is an ill-defined concept. If it is to be considered a scientific (holistic) entity, the ecosystem finds its definitional and accompanying features within the ecological field of systems ecology, which declined after the 1970s under pressures of persisting unsolved puzzles and problems. Our research focuses on the background assumptions fuelling the difficulties that system ecologists encounter in sufficiently determining ecosystem’s borders and anchoring ‘ecosystem’ holism in the empirical world. The results indicate that biology teachers address the topic of ecosystem delimitation from a perspective that apparently differs from the realistic/empirical and instrumental perspectives of system ecologists. Moreover, biology teachers cannot engage with how system ecologists delimit ecosystems and instead resort to their personal experience (e.g. individualist insights) and naïve relational ideas, which along with deficiencies in systems thinking and in Nature of science (NOS) reasoning result in the development of an ‘ecosystem’ version that appears inconsistent with (ecosystem) holism. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

SSR comprises four competencies: recognising complexity of SSI’s, multiple perspectives around SSI’s, the need for ongoing inquiry around SSI’s, and skepticism around different parties’ claims made about SSI’s. The Quantitative Assessment of SSR (QuASSR) provides a promising measurement framework, but there are still important questions around the ability of this instrument to measure transfer across different scenarios and change in SSR over an intervention. Further, prior work suggests that the four competencies may constitute a progression. We explored the ability of the QuASSR to measure transfer of SSR across three different SSI’s using 2-faceted and multi-faceted Rasch models. We used path analysis to test the hypothesis that competencies associated with SSR formed a progression. We found transfer or neartransfer of SSR across the three scenarios, and that the competencies comprise a unidimensional hierarchy. Perspective-taking is a necessary bridge between students’ understanding of complexity and the higher-level competencies of inquiry and skepticism. Inquiry and skepticism were found to be conditionally independent upon accounting for perspective-taking, supporting the idea that seeing multiple perspectives around SSI’s is central to development of the other SSR competencies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Based on the idea of inquiry methods, the ScieNo-framework includes three scientific reasoning competencies (‘Scie’) and ten naïve and informed NOSI views (‘No’) that can be aligned on a theoretical level. We test this alignment using data from a quantitative cross-sectional study. In this study, internationally published instruments on scientific reasoning and NOSI views were administered in a sample of 802 students. We estimate structural equation models (SEM) that encompass correlations between scientific reasoning competencies and NOSI views. In order to control for effects of schooling in a second step, we included the grade level as a predictor into these models and checked whether the correlations were stable. The results confirm small to high positive and negative correlations between informed and naïve NOSI views and the scientific reasoning competencies that match the theory-based assumption.

Thus, this study examined the extent to which IBST and NOS are featured in secondary school curriculum documents for science subjects. In addition, the challenges facing the integration of IBST and NOS in science teaching in Tanzanian secondary schools are highlighted. By analysing five curriculum documents and the Basic Education Statistics in Tanzania, the study established that IBST and NOS are neither formally recognised as important aspects of science education, nor given due attention in curriculum documents. Moreover, a lack of coherence among various elements of the curriculum, which can affect the integration of IBST and NOS, was observed. Finally, it was established that several challenges such as larger class sizes, insufficient time allocation and overemphasis on content coverage need to be addressed so that IBST and NOS could be fully integrated into science teaching in Tanzania.

These practices are a key feature of science education reform documents in the US. However, a common definition of just what makes for the authentic doing of science is hard to come by and certainly lacks consensus. In this paper, the case will be made for a new framework building upon and updating prior conceptualizations that could be utilised by science teacher educators, science teachers, and science education researchers to classify the authentic nature of scientific work generally and that is performed in the science classroom specifically. The framework consists of three dimensions. These are the similarities between the practices that students engage in and those employed by professional scientists, the degree to which the activity is meaningful to the learner, and the extent to which the work is significant to others. Examples of classroom activities will be discussed in terms of these three dimensions.

In this paper, we examine the generality of this approach in learning chemistry. Students' reasoning in chemistry in terms of emergent complex systems is explored for two curricula: a normative and a complexity-based one, so that the interaction could be examined under both the conditions. A quasi-experimental pretest-intervention-posttest comparison group design was used to explore student's learning, complemented with interview data. The experimental group (n = 47) studied the topic of gases with a complexity-based curriculum. A comparison group (n = 45) studied with a normative curriculum for the same duration. Students' answers to questionnaires were coded with a complexity-based approach that included levels (distinguishing micro- and macro-levels), stochastic particle behaviors, the emergence of macro-level patterns from micro-level behaviors, and the source of control in the system. It was found that students' reasoning about chemistry concepts in terms of complex systems falls into three distinct and coherent mental models. A sophisticated mental model included most of the above-described complexity features, while the nonsophisticated model included none. The intermediate model is typified by distinguishing between levels, but not by stochastic and emergent behaviors. The nonsophisticated mental model was used mostly in the pretest. In the posttest, the experimental group used the intermediate and sophisticated models; while the comparison group used the nonsophisticated and intermediate models. Discussion approaches the topics of the generality of the complex systems approach; and the unique forms of reasoning that a complexity approach may contribute to learning science. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Participants were three urban science teachers who were selected among 12 teachers from a professional development (PD) program focusing on Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) instructional model. These three teachers completed PCK of argumentation assessments; they were observed while implementing the argumentation investigations and reflected on and interviewed about their teaching experiences after each enactment and at the end of the study. The findings illustrate that these teachers experience positive shifts in their PCK of argumentation; a teacher with evaluativist epistemological beliefs has high-quality PCK of argumentation, which is reflected in her teaching practices aligning with the expectations of the ADI model. However, if teachers’ epistemology included multiplist elements, they modify the ADI investigations even though they have improved their PCK of argumentation. This finding addresses how teachers’ epistemological beliefs are connected to their teaching actions. The results show that different aspects of epistemological beliefs and PCK of argumentation are linked to teachers’ use of argumentation investigations.

The two cases—Literacy Science (a science and literacy curriculum for grades 2–5) and Science as Inquiry (a curriculum focused on matter for grades 3–5)—were selected because the curricula shared many key features, yet the designers undertook the challenge of designing for adaptation in substantially different ways. Data sources for analysis included interviews with design team members, the curriculum materials, and a range of project documentation. A comparative case study approach was chosen to enable an examination of key contrasting features within the context of each curriculum. Both curricula provide teachers with supports to enact an inquiry-based curriculum in ways that honor science epistemologies. However, one designer team designed explicitly for adaptation by providing worked examples that described a range of possible classroom and learner contingencies, along with alternative solutions. By contrast, the other design 9team sought to build teachers' pedagogical capacity by providing access to content and explanations from the cognitive and natural sciences. The paper examines how these design stances informed materials developed to support teachers' content knowledge, as well as students' scientific inquiry and classroom discourse. These approaches represent different points on a continuum of design for adaptation, each with its own consequences for enactment and the design of written materials.

Said framework consists of three stages (formulation of the design principles, instructional design and design of the learning activities). It is based on four design principles: (1) the context-scientific model relationship as the axis around which the teaching-learning sequence is based, (2) scientific practices as tools for treating the problem and constructing the scientific model, (3) use of driven questions, and (4) promotion of knowledge transfer. Similarly, the choice of context, the proposal of questions, the drafting of objectives, selection of knowledge, design of the sequence of activities and design of the evaluation are important during instructional design. This framework has been used to design a teaching-learning sequence based on learning the lactic fermentation model in the context of yoghurt preparation such that argumentation, inquiry and modelling play a key role in the educational treatment. Implementation of this teaching-learning sequence has shown an improvement in the lactic fermentation models proposed by Spanish students aged 14–16 years.

We undertook a secondary analysis of the PISA 2015 Taiwan dataset of 7,973 students from 214 schools to identify critical issues of student learning and potentially reshape our educational system and policies. Thus, this study sought to identify potential latent clusters of students' scientific literacy performance according to a set of focus variables selected from the PISA student questionnaires. In addition, significant determinants of students' scientific literacy and resiliency were analyzed. Cluster analysis results demonstrated the presence of four clusters of high, medium, low, and inferior scientific literacy/epistemology/affective dispositions. Specifically, students in cluster 1 compared with other clusters showed that the higher the scientific literacy scores are, the more positive epistemic beliefs about science, achievement motivation, enjoyment of science, interests in broad science, science self-efficacy, information and communications technology (ICT) interest, ICT autonomy, more learning time, more teacher supports and teacher-directed instructions are. Regression results indicated that the most robust predictor of students' scientific literacy performance is epistemic beliefs about science, followed by learning time, interest in broad science topics, achievement motivation, inquiry-based science teaching and learning practice, and science self-efficacy. Decision tree model results showed that the descending order of the variables in terms of their importance in differentiating students as high- versus low-performing were epistemic beliefs about science, learning time, self-efficacy, interest in broad science, and scientific inquiry, respectively. A similar decision tree model to determine students as resilient versus non-resilient also was found. Various interpretations of these results are discussed, as are their implications for science education research, science teaching, and science education policy. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The instructor modelled use of children’s literature, debriefing of inquiry lessons, and reflection to teach young children about NOS. Results showed that preservice teachers not only refined their conceptions of NOS, but were able to conceptualise ways to teach NOS to young children. They were able to plan, deliver, and reflect upon their teaching, and design a children’s picture book to teach about NOS. The researchers found nearly all of the preservice teachers portrayed NOS aspects accurately through their stories, and the stories could introduce these NOS ideas to early childhood students.

Selected competences, derived from a collection of leading curricula, are explored through interviews and practical tasks, each consisting of three probes. The 51 students, aged 15 and commencing post-compulsory science education in the Netherlands, were able to carry out basic skills such as collecting data and representing these. In interpreting the data in terms of the investigated phenomenon or situation however, performance was weak. Students often appeared to be unable to identify the crucial features of a given graph. Conclusions based on the data were often tautological or superficial, lacking salient features. Students failed to infer implications from the data, to interpret data at a higher level of abstraction, or to specify limitations to the validity of the analysis or conclusions. The findings imply that the students’ understanding of data-analysis should be developed further before they can engage successfully in more ‘open’ practical work.

Against this background, the aim of the present study was to find out whether views on the nature of scientific inquiry (NOSI views) should be conceptualized and quantitatively assessed in a more multiplistic manner, considering naïve and informed views in their own, separate dimensions. Based on a competence model defining three inquiry methods, we developed a Likert-scaled questionnaire containing 10 scales, each assessing one NOSI view. We administered the questionnaire to a sample of 802 students in the lower and upper levels of secondary school. Based on structural equation modeling, the analyses confirmed a 10-dimensional model, distinguishing between each naïve and informed views as the only adequate representation of the data. Latent class analysis and interview data revealed four profiles of NOSI views in the data, which differed with regard to their agreement or disagreement with different naïve and informed views. We interpret these findings as evidence that supports more multiplistic models, with relevance to conceptualizing, measuring, and fostering NOSI views.

We re-examine this issue by examining whether the association between inquiry and learning depends upon the provision of teacher guidance. Participants were 151,721 students from 5089 schools from 10 highest and 10 lowest science performers in PISA 2015. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses found that measurement invariance cannot be established, suggesting substantial regional variation in the pattern of inquiry-based instruction. Nonetheless, exploratory factor analyses indicated that at the conceptual level, many regions exhibit a pattern which contrasted between ‘Guided inquiry’ and ‘Independent inquiry’. Results of structural equation modelling showed that inquiry is positively associated with outcomes when it incorporates teacher guidance, and negatively when it doesn’t. However, the strength of the positive associations is stronger in regions where guided inquiry is measured with fewer items referring to student-centred activities. These findings are in line with current theories regarding the importance of scaffolding in learning from inquiry. This study suggests that it would be misguided to use PISA findings to support arguments to scale back inquiry and other constructivist approaches to teaching science. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The goal was to describe the types of understanding of gas behavior held by a group of participants with high metacognitive awareness (MA) and a group with low MA before and after the MR instruction. A total of 34 preservice chemistry teachers participated in the study. Data sources included the metacognitive awareness inventory and the two-tier nature of gases diagnostic questionnaire. Data from these sources were coded and analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. A statistically significant difference was observed for the understanding of gas behavior before the MR instruction between the participants with high MA and those with low MA. Both groups of participants exhibited substantial progress toward a scientific understanding from pre- to post-instruction. However, the participants with high MA outperformed those with low MA in terms of developing a more scientific understanding of gas behavior after the MR instruction. In addition, following the MR instruction, while the participants with high MA eliminated 85% of their alternative conceptions, the participants with low MA eliminated only about 60% of their alternative conceptions. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

One aspect not much investigated is the progressiveness of that discourse. For progressiveness to exist, interactions must tend to be symmetrical and power imbalances in dialogue must be reduced to a minimum. Also, a real dialogue must be established between the worldviews of participants. In this article we investigate this topic by analysing two sessions on thermodynamics taught by the same teacher (years 2016 and 2017). In both, the teacher presents the same problem situation. After the first session, and before the second one, the teacher analyzed her own videos with the purpose of designing classes with a greater dialogical component. The research carried out seeks to describe the changes in the teacher's actions and how these are articulated with the changes in student’s interactions. For the analysis we used a social mechanism identified by Clarà (2019) to describe progressiveness, which consists of a series of iterations of the sequence (Direction) → Inference ↔ Observation ↔ Consensus → Fixation. Through this model, we were able to account for progressiveness in collective inquiry, and also to distinguish more and less fruitful teacher-interventions to foster it. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

We find that the SUPS affords significantly larger learning gains and that it is no more likely than the conventional simulation to cause misconceptions. In addition, we find that users of the participatory simulation report significantly more interest and enjoyment than users of the conventional simulation. Additional qualitative analysis suggests that students perceive participatory simulations as more helpful because they enable a deeper interaction with the model and are more engaging than conventional simulations.

Socioscientific issues (SSIs) are real-world problems that are complex in their acknowledgement of social as well as scientific aspects of the problem and are well-suited to support scientific literacy objectives. Because of their potential local and personal relevance, some research suggests that characteristics of the SSIs themselves could dictate the sophistication of the socioscientific reasoning or SSR, individuals use when they think about SSIs. However, this notion has not been measured quantitatively by directly comparing levels of individual components of SSR employed for two different topics of SSI. Using repeated-measures MANCOVA, I compare high-school student reasoning sophistication levels on components SSR for two SSIs–one on an environmental and one on a genetics issue. This inquiry is important to inform teachers of how they may need to approach SSIs differently depending on the topic and in its suggestion that students need to be exposed to a variety of SSIs to fully develop transferable SSR skills. Results suggest that students do reason about the SSIs differently in some areas.

The instructor-student collaborative partnership has the potential to transform education from traditional instructor-directed, transmissive teaching to active, participatory student-centered learning. However, relevant inquiry indicates the conceptual, analytical, and practical gaps on the instructor-student collaborative partnership. This study aims to conceptualize, analyze, and foster the instructor-student collaborative partnership in higher education contexts. To achieve this purpose, we empirically investigate the instructor-student collaborative partnership in an online course where the instructor uses a learning-community approach to foster learning. Using mixed methods, we examine the instructor-student collaborative partnership from the participation frequency, engagement move, and participant perception perspectives. Results show that the instructor and students not only actively participate in learning, instruction, and social environment building processes, but also maintain mutual interactions, communications, and actions to construct knowledge, to design and facilitate discussions, and to build a social learning environment. In addition, most participants perceive a sense of an online learning community in this online course.

In South Africa, the introduction of inquiry-based instruction in a reformed science curriculum has met with serious challenges, such as the under-preparedness of in-service teachers. The purpose of this study was to capture, portray and develop the pedagogical practice of Physical Sciences teachers in inquiry-based teaching using an empowerment evaluation approach. The study is a multiple case study in inquiry-based teaching of three Physical Sciences teachers in South Africa using a mixed methods design. Empowerment evaluation is the use of evaluation concepts, techniques, and findings to foster improvement and self-determination. Underlying an inquiry-based pedagogy is the assumption that science education is not merely about knowing-acquisition, but understanding how scientific knowledge is generated, evaluation of knowledge claims and conducting scientific research. Data were collected by means of semi-structured interviews, a pedagogical orientation instrument, and classroom observations. The findings reveal that through empowerment evaluation, teacher practices in the classroom shifted towards an inquiry-based approach. The empowerment evaluation approach thus offers a viable and sustained form of professional development that is likely to empower teachers in assessing, planning, implementing and evaluating what they do. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

This is particularly true in museums where dwell times are short and visitors can enter and exit exhibits at varying times. In response, this work aimed to answer two questions: 1) How can we combine learning analytics and qualitative approaches to understand how learners move from unproductive to productive states during open-ended inquiry? 2) What role do interactions with others play in supporting participants' transitions to productive states? To answer these questions, this study examined how combining a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and interaction analysis together can reveal important elements of participants’ collaboration and exploration that would likely be lost if each method were applied in isolation. The methods were applied to visitors participating at an interactive multi-touch exhibit (named Oztoc). The application of HMM successfully captured when participants transitioned from persistent unproductive to productive states, while interaction analysis using the Divergent Collaborative Learning Mechanisms framework (DCLM) showed how specific divergent collaborative interactions supported these transitions. In particular, we reveal the role that visitors engaging in Boundary Spanning Perception and Boundary Spanning Action played in these transitions. More broadly, this work shows how designs that provide opportunities for these kinds of interactions may help learners effectively transition out of sustained states of unproductive persistence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

HLMs were estimated to test the contribution of each item to students’ science achievement scores. Some inquiry practices demonstrated a significant, linear, positive relationship to science achievement (particularly items involving contextualising science learning). Two of the negatively associated items (explaining their ideas and doing experiments) were found to have a curvilinear relationship to science achievement. All nine items were dummy coded by the reported frequency of use and an optimum frequency was determined using the categorical model and by calculating the inflection point of the curvilinear associations in the previous model e.g. students that carry out experiments in the lab in some lessons have higher achievement scores than students who perform experiments in all lessons.

Our main aim was to advance methods for analysing temporal aspects of technology-enhanced learning (TEL) processes by introducing the temporal lag sequential analysis (TLSA) technique and by combining TLSA with temporal log data analysis (TLDA). Our secondary aim was to illustrate the potential of these two analysis techniques to reveal the differences between the face-to-face technology-enhanced collaborative inquiry-based learning (CIBL) processes of three different conditions (non-scaffolded, writing scaffolded and script scaffolded groups). The study involved undergraduate university students (N = 231) in natural sciences. The TLDA was based on timestamps and groups' inputs into a TEL environment, and it focused on the groups' temporal ways of using technological resources. The TLSA was based on screen capture videos and audio recordings of the groups' CIBL processes, and it focused on the inquiry-based learning (IBL) transition patterns (i.e. the transitions between the different IBL phases) discovered by lag sequential analysis and demonstrated by how the IBL transition patterns temporarily emerged. The TLDA findings demonstrated temporal differences regarding how the groups in the different conditions used the available technological resources. The TLSA findings revealed three temporarily distinct IBL transition pattern clusters whose content and temporal emergence varied depending on the condition. Parallel temporal analysis of the log data and the IBL transition patterns indicated that the use of the technological resources temporarily mediated IBL transition patterns. Specifically, we found advantages similar to those of asynchronous online discussions (think before acting) when face-to-face interaction was enhanced with the writing scaffold. The article concludes with a general discussion of the necessity and potential of temporal analysis. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

This study assessed how the Emerging Scholars Environmental Health Sciences Academy, a supplemental summer science programme for public high school students in Louisiana, Alabama, and Florida in the southern United States, influenced participants’ science motivation, as measured by the Science Motivation Questionnaire II (SMQII). The SMQII assesses five motivation factors for learning science: intrinsic motivation, self-determination, self-efficacy, career motivation, and grade motivation. Participants (n = 45) completed the SMQII before and after completing the academy, which allowed students to learn, apply, and experience environmental health science. Results indicated a statistically significant increase in motivation to learn science among participants, particularly for self-determination and career motivation. Inquiry-based learning, individual mentoring, and exposure to environmental health careers may explain why the academy was effective in positively influencing participants’ self-determination and career motivation.

Literature reports about several recommendations regarding teaching systems thinking, while it seems that systems thinking has not reached classroom practice. The main aim of this study was to identify design guidelines to implement systems thinking in upper-secondary biologyeducation. Based on the recommendations of literature and experience a teacher team developed, tested and evaluated two lessons in two upper-secondary biology classes (15–16 years old students, n = 26, n = 19) using Lesson Study. Lesson one focused on the application of seven system characteristics: boundary, components, interactions, input & output, feedback, dynamics, and hierarchy. Lesson two focused on the improvement of students’ understanding of the characteristics feedback and dynamics by using a qualitative modelling approach. Based on classroom observations, student products and interviews, the results suggest that a first step is made: most students are able to name and apply the seven characteristics. It seems important to pay attention to the: (1) introduction of the seven characteristics; (2) application of the characteristics in a wide variety of contexts; (3) individual characteristics; (4) explicit use of system language. © 2020 The Author(s).

Integrated STEM is pushing the boundaries of some of the traditional assumptions in education—disciplined-based courses, courses taught independently by teachers, standards and content-driven, and no collaborative planning time for teachers. Six teachers, located in two high schools, participated in a year-long program to develop interdisciplinary collaboration to implement integrated STEM learning in their courses. A qualitative instrumental case study of the two teams of teachers was conducted to gain insights and understandings of the teachers’ beliefs and instructional practices of STEM integration through interdisciplinary approaches in a complex system (i.e., hydroponics). Results: Themes regarding features, beliefs and practices, and challenges emerged from cross-case analysis of the teachers’ stories, which resulted in two interdisciplinary collaboration models, multi-classroom and extracurricular activity, from each of the teams at each of the two high schools. Multi-classroom and extracurricular activity models had some resemblances, but also had differences. Both cases had the same goals to use real-world problems to help students see STEM connections, learn STEM knowledge and skills, and apply STEM knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems. Conclusions: Based on teachers’ beliefs and their interdisciplinary STEM collaboration practices, three components were identified. Team size, teaching goal, and collaboration structure highly affect a successful interdisciplinary STEM collaboration model in high school settings. The study also contributes to expend the concept of a continuum of STEM approaches to curriculum integration, disciplinary, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary (Vasquez, Sneider, & Comer, STEM lesson essentials: Integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, 2013), and provides frameworks for structuring a successful interdisciplinary collaboration model in high school settings. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

Social constructivist learning, where teachers and learners engage in discussion, argumentation, shared collective discourse, guided practice and apprenticeship underpin the methods utilised for supporting children’s inquiry learning in this project. Data sources included children’s interviews, audiotaped classroom interactions, children’s work samples, and interviews with the teacher. The analysis indicates that in the beginning of the project, Lauren, the classroom teacher, did not observe the depth and quality of learning and had to teach foundational skills for inquiry with children. Later in the project, she began seeing her learners’ high intellectual capabilities and autonomy and allowed them to be more autonomous in the learning process. However, Lauren still struggled with sharing the initiative and authority with children and letting children lead the learning processes. Lauren’s story is an example of the potential challenges that other teachers face as they begin exploring constructivist approaches. Real and honest accounts of the implementation of high-quality practices in urban schools, where traditional approaches are common, are important to support other practitioners in similar contexts, who also intend to transform their practices. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The goal is for students to realize the importance of science and engineering in innovation and in solving many of today’s challenges. The Next Generation Science Standards contends that a working knowledge and practicality of engineering design prepares students for embracing the challenges of the future. To support students in developing these capabilities, teachers are tasked with the responsibility of facilitating science instruction that integrates science and engineering practices. This is a challenge since a majority of them have little to no understanding of engineering applications. Results: An interdisciplinary team, consisting of science education and mechanical engineering faculty and doctoral students from each discipline, and science, mathematics, and career and technical curriculum supervisors, collaborated with middle school science, mathematics, and career and technical education teachers to develop a framework for integrating engineering practices into their curricula. The exploratory nature of the project, and instructional outcomes with their students, supported teachers in developing an understanding and value for science and engineering practices. As a result, they were motivated to critique and revise their practices, aiming to develop and implement instruction that they perceived as beneficial to their students. Conclusion: With the surge in emphasis on preparing K-12 students for the STEM workforce, initiatives devoted to exposing teachers and students to STEM applications have also increased. The findings from this study could be useful for informing these initiatives, since they reveal the learning experiences of the teachers while processing instructional strategies for integrating science and engineering practices into their curriculum. The findings highlight factors that motivated these teachers to reform their instructional practices, as well as their deliberations while endeavoring to assimilate the strategies into their curricular activities. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

A total of 49 eighth-grade students at a public junior high school in northern Taiwan participated. Data collected include the students' pre- and post-scores for school science achievement, logging data that indicate their inquiry processes, and pretest, posttest, and delayed-test data that measure their scientific literacy. The results provide evidence that the designed simulation and inquiry support had a long-term effect on the students' scientific literacy. Replacing conventional teaching with inquiry activities did not harm the students' school science achievement performances. Moreover, compared to school science achievement, students' scientific literacy seems a better predictor of their inquiry behavior, especially in the aspect of making conclusions. Analyses of the students’ inquiry processes indicate that the so-called low science achieving students conducted more data analyses than the other students, and demonstrated adequate inquiry engagement. The students with middle level school science achievement demonstrated the most active engagement in inquiry and showed good gains of scientific literacy after the learning. These results indicate that a guided inquiry learning environment can support students with different levels of school science achievement to highly engage in science inquiry.

Data on situational interest and ongoing classroom activities were obtained using the experience sampling method, with measurements taken three times during a lesson. The process yielded a total of 1717 measurements in the Finnish schools and 1767 in the Chilean schools. Multilevel regression analyses with mixed effects and random intercept were conducted. Results showed a positive effect of scientific practices that required asking questions, designing scientific inquiry and interpreting data on situational interest. Student collaborative situations were more interesting for Chilean students than for Finnish ones. In terms of gender differences, on average, Finnish male and female students experienced the same level of situational interest, while the situational interest of Chilean female students was higher than the average of male students.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of using the 1984 dystopian novel associated with socio-scientific issues (SSI) in the development of moral values and reasoning skills of high school students. An interdisciplinary didactic program encompassing the Arts, Philosophy and Biology subjects was elaborated to stimulate discussion and debates around SSIs. The didactic intervention was evaluated through a questionnaire and the 1984 film debate. The students were able to explore scientific concepts to discuss social issues and correlated the allegory of the cave topic with alienation and the 1984 novel. The students also recognised that the approached issues are related not only to their life in society but to existential human conditions. We claim that dystopian texts allied to SSI debates can function as creativity triggers to stimulate students developing the inquiry skills and dispositions needed to express themselves, challenging fake news and uncovering new possibilities to apprehend the truth. © 2021 The Author(s).

It gives students few opportunities to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to take advantage of graphs, and which are called for by current science education standards. Yet, it is not well known how to support graphing skills, particularly within middle school science inquiry contexts. Using qualitative graphs is a promising, but underexplored approach. In contrast to quantitative graphs, which can lead students to focus too narrowly on the mechanics of plotting points, qualitative graphs can encourage students to relate graphical representations to their conceptual meaning. Guided by the Knowledge Integration framework, which recognizes and guides students in integrating their diverse ideas about science, we incorporated qualitative graphing activities into a seventh grade web-based inquiry unit about cell division and cancer treatment. In Study 1, we characterized the kinds of graphs students generated in terms of their integration of graphical and scientific knowledge. We also found that students (n = 30) using the unit made significant learning gains based on their pretest to post-test scores. In Study 2, we compared students' performance in two versions of the same unit: One that had students construct, and second that had them critique qualitative graphs. Results showed that both activities had distinct benefits, and improved students' (n = 117) integrated understanding of graphs and science. Specifically, critiquing graphs helped students improve their scientific explanations within the unit, while constructing graphs led students to link key science ideas within both their in-unit and post-unit explanations. We discuss the relative affordances and constraints of critique and construction activities, and observe students' common misunderstandings of graphs. In all, this study offers a critical exploration of how to design instruction that simultaneously supports students' science and graph understanding within complex inquiry contexts. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Yet scant research has investigated science notebook use with students who are learning science in a language they are working to master. To explore how student science notebook use is co-constructed in interaction among students and teachers, this study examined plurilingual students' interactions with open-ended science notebooks during an inquiry science unit on condensation and evaporation. Grounded in theoretical views of the notebook as a semiotic social space, multimodal interaction analysis facilitated examination of the ways students drew upon the space afforded by the notebook as they constructed explanations of their understandings. Cross-group comparison of three focal groups led to multiple assertions regarding the use of science notebooks with plurilingual students. First, the notebook supported student-determined paths of resemiotization as students employed multiple communicative resources to express science understandings. Second, notebooks provided spaces for students to draw upon diverse language resources and as a bridge in time across multiple inquiry sessions. Third, representations in notebooks were leveraged by both students and teachers to access and deepen conceptual conversations. Lastly, students' interactions over time revealed multiple epistemological orientations in students' use of the notebook space.

Data were gathered from the series of questionnaires administered to 1566 Chinese students with an average age of 11.5. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis results confirmed our assumption that when students perceived technology-assisted teacher support, this promoted their TESI hardiness, indirectly increasing their perceived TESI. Perceived technology-assisted teacher support and TESI were found to be positively correlated in this structural model. However, by including TESI hardiness in the mediational mechanism, its direct relationship with both perceived technology-assisted teacher support and perceived TESI was insignificant, while the mediating effects remained significant. Therefore, TESI hardiness is of considerable importance for delineating the relationship between perceived technology-assisted teacher support and perceived TESI. It was revealed that both the interpersonal variable (perceived technology-assisted teacher support) and the individual variable (TESI hardiness) are vital in determining the effectiveness of TESI. These findings enhance the understanding of and approach to the promotion of students’ perception of scientific inquiry by emphasising the value of technology-assisted teacher support and hardiness. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Data were collected via the five sources: The Views About Scientific Inquiry questionnaire, inquiry-based 5E lesson plan, classroom observations, video recordings, and semi-structured interviews. The results showed that some aspects of nature of scientific inquiry were positively changed (e.g. ‘multiple scientific methods’) while some aspects were not altered significantly (e.g. ‘same procedures may not get the same results’). This study, also, showed that pre-service science teachers could partly transfer their understanding of nature of scientific inquiry into their teaching practices for some reasons, including participants’ subject matter knowledge, motivations, practicing skills, and personal characteristics.

The article is based on qualitative data to enable analyses of the students’ processes of conceptual learning as interactive sense-making, as discussions, verbalisation and use. The activities of the learners are studied in detail from a socio-constructive perspective with regard to how they relate previous knowledge and experiences to theory, investigating the progress of conceptual learning inspired by the notion of a coordination class (diSessa, A. A., & Sherin, B. L. [1998].

Rather than solely providing information about what has been achieved or the accuracy of student responses (product data), students' log files offer additional insights into how the responses were produced (process data). In this study, we examined students' log files to detect patterns of students' interactions with computer-based assessment and to determine whether unique characteristics of these interactions emerge as distinct profiles of inquiry performance. Knowledge about the characteristics of these profiles can shed light on why some students are more successful at solving simulated inquiry tasks than others and how to support student understanding of scientific inquiry through computer-based environments. We analyzed the Norwegian PISA 2015 log-file data, science performance as well as background questionnaire (N = 1,222 students) by focusing on two inquiry tasks, which required scientific reasoning skills: coordinating the effects of multiple variables and coordinating theory and evidence. Using a mixture modeling approach, we identified three distinct profiles of students' inquiry performance: strategic, emergent, and disengaged. These profiles revealed different characteristics of students' exploration behavior, inquiry strategy, time-on-task, and item accuracy. Further analyses showed that students' assignment to these profiles varied according to their demographic characteristics (gender, socio-economic status, and language at home), attitudes (enjoyment in science, self-efficacy, and test anxiety), and science achievement. Although students' profiles on the two inquiry tasks were significantly related, we also found some variations in the proportion of students' transitions between profiles. Our study contributes to understanding how students interact with complex simulated inquiry tasks and showcases how log-file data from PISA 2015 can aid this understanding. © 2020 The Authors.

This case study investigates how upper-elementary students responded to an online prompt, in an embedded assessment tool, to construct a scientific explanation around the variation of traits in their class and how a teacher provided feedback to encourage student discourse. Our findings show that students were able to identify which traits were more common in their class; however, they struggled with making a connection between variation of traits and inheritance of traits when analyzing data from their pie chart. Additionally, we show that an upper-elementary teacher used an embedded assessment tool to scaffold the iterative process of learning and feedback that occurs in an online platform that leverages learning technologies by engaging in high-level discourse moves.

Therefore, five pre-service teachers enrolled in a university undergraduate course called ‘Inquiry-based chemistry education II’ (5 ECTS) were involved in an empirical case study. The pre-service teachers’ implementations of inquiry were studied from their reports on self-designed context-based inquiry teaching sequences for students age 13–15, and their beliefs by interviewing them after the course. The results indicate that the most frequent aspects of inquiry, which were implemented, were that inquiry (i) includes a context, (ii) is a way to act, (iii) is a way to think, and (iv) includes source/information evaluation and argumentation. The pre-service teachers’ beliefs about inquiry were shown to reflect manifold aspects of inquiry, such as the difficulty in explaining it. However, this difficulty in encapsulating inquiry into a clear-cut definition is not necessarily an impediment to inquiry-based teaching. Furthermore, inquiry is inherently context-bound, and context-based teaching requires extra-situational knowledge from the context and not only declarative knowledge from science.

In principle, developing students' epistemic understanding would enhance students' capability in evaluating scientific claims. However, findings on this “expected” connection have been inconclusive. This paper seeks to examine this discrepancy between epistemic understanding in theory, and the practical application of this understanding. It uses the concept of adherence from the literature on conceptual change when accounting for this discrepancy. Questionnaires were used to examine adherences to epistemic understanding in evaluating health-related claims by 42 college-level nonscience majors. Follow-up interviews were conducted to explain their adherences to epistemic understanding during their evaluation. The analysis revealed that: (a) Students tended to adhere to process of inquiry much stronger than the nature of scientific knowledge and the social context of science. (b) Students' low adherence to the nature of scientific findings and generation process was found to relate to an interplay among various epistemic aspects of science. (c) Students demonstrated low adherence in practicing epistemic understanding due to difference in contexts between giving declarative statements about science and using epistemic understanding to evaluate scientific claims. These findings have theoretical implications on the discrepancy between theory and practice in relation to the role of epistemic understanding of science, and on what constitutes informed epistemic understanding. They also have practical implications in terms of enhancing students' adherences to epistemic understanding in evaluating scientific claims. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

In one school, the intervention involves the use of a class set of 3D Printing Pens, and in another school the use of dynamic geometry environments, for inquiry-based learning of the relations among the number of vertices, edges, and faces of prisms and pyramids. An instrument was designed as guided by the van Hiele model of geometric thinking and administered to the two groups in the form of pretests, posttests, and delayed posttests to assess students’ prior knowledge before the intervention started, the learning outcomes obtained immediately after intervention, and the retention of knowledge after the interventions had been completed for a sustained period of time. The purpose of this study is to explore differences in geometry learning outcomes in two technology-enhanced environments, one that involves dynamic, visual representations of geometry and another that involves embodied actions of constructing physical 3D solids. Results: The results show that students using dynamic geometry improved at a higher rate than those using 3D Pens. On the other hand, students with the aid of 3D Pens demonstrated better retention of the properties of 3D solids than their dynamic geometry counterparts. Namely, the posttest results show that the dynamic geometry environment (DGE) group generally outperformed the 3D Pen group across categories. The observed outperformance by the DGE group on “advanced” implies that the DGE technology had a stronger effect on higher levels of geometric learning. However, the results from the ANCOVA suggest that the retention effect was more significant with 3D Pens. Conclusions: This study has established evidence that the DGE instructions produced strong but relatively temporary geometry learning outcomes, while 3D Pen instructions can help solidify that knowledge. The results of this study further shed light on the effect of visual and sensory-motor experiences on school mathematics learning and corroborate previous work showing that the effects of gesture are particularly good at promoting long-lasting learning. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

This study systematically reviewed 49 articles regarding ML-based science assessment through a triangle framework with technical, validity, and pedagogical features on three vertices. We found that a majority of the studies focused on the validity vertex, as compared to the other two vertices. The existing studies primarily involve text recognition, classification, and scoring with an emphasis on constructing scientific explanations, with a vast range of human-machine agreement measures. To achieve the agreement measures, most of the studies employed a cross-validation method, rather than self- or split-validation. ML allows complex assessments to be used by teachers without the burden of human scoring, saving both time and cost. Most studies used supervised ML, which relies on extraction of attributes from student work that was first coded by humans to achieve automaticity, rather than semi- or unsupervised ML. We found that 24 studies were explicitly embedded in science learning activities, such as scientific inquiry and argumentation, to provide feedback or learning guidance. This study identifies existing research gaps and suggests that all three vertices of the ML triangle should be addressed in future assessment studies, with an emphasis on the pedagogy and technology features. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Review","Scopus"

This study investigated whether these gains persisted over a longer time scale, rather than just after the completion of a given experiment. Student focus groups were conducted at the completion of units (sometimes known as a course) in which more than half of the laboratory experiments were redesigned. Annual surveys were distributed to monitor students’ perceptions of the aims of teaching laboratories, and their expectations of their own behaviour. The findings indicated that the previously noted positive outcomes were still evident at the end of a semester. The annual survey showed that whilst 2nd year students were able to appreciate the real world context of the experiments, 3rd year students did not. Overall, the large-scale changes away from expository experiments had a positive impact on student enjoyment and perceived skill development but only when meaningful proportions of the experiments were redesigned. It would appear that the continuing existence of many expository experiments undermined the students’ perceptions of the benefits gained by the new laboratory experiments. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Building on current research in this field, and using a micro-ethnographic approach informed by socio-semiotic perspectives, we aimed to identify how and why student drawing can contribute to student reasoning and learning. In our study, secondary school students were challenged to explore and collaboratively create explanatory representations of phenomena including through drawing. Data were generated using multiple wall- and ceiling-mounted cameras capable of continuously tracking groups of students negotiating these representational challenges. Our analysis proceeded through active and iterative viewing of the extensive video record, and the identification of themes to establish possible relationships between drawing and reasoning. Through this process, we (a) identify multiple necessary conditions and varied opportunities for student drawing to enact and enable reasoning, and (b) extend current understandings of how the particular affordances of this mode interact with these conditions to contribute to student learning in science. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Each presence is subdivided, resulting in a structure in ten categories at the basis for the CoI survey instrument. Although the survey structure in three presences was repeatedly validated in the literature, the categories within presences were not and were consequently investigated in this study. High internal consistencies between items of each category demonstrated that the structure is reliable. Its convergent and discriminant validity were confirmed using multi-group confirmatory factor analyses, that further allowed to reinforce the construct validation by evaluating its factorial invariance across independent samples collected in two universities and varying in gender and age (n1 = 343; n2 =420). To assess its discriminant validity and because high estimated correlations between categories were observed, alternative structures in eight, seven and six factors were also compared to the original ten-category structure. They were all valid despite yielding inferior fits. The partial structural invariance of CoI structures in categories were also confirmed across groups. Next, a CoI structure in three presences resulted in an insufficient fit to data across independent groups. Much more conclusively, a second-order structure including both presences and categories demonstrated a very good fit to the data, highlighting the importance of categories to reflect students' perceptions. This paper, although presented at a conceptual level, enlightens the potential of studying the influence of categories on each other, learning outcomes, or to identify areas of improvement in online and blended courses by relying on meaningful and trustful categories that further characterize the well-known presences. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

We seek to understand how the body supports cognition and learning during and after embodiment. We elaborate upon the liminal blends framework (Enyedy, N., Danish, J. A., & DeLiema, D. (2015).

International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 10(1), 7–34.) to understand how many resources are taken up, blended together, and progressively refined towards canonical scientific understanding. By tracing the body, we demonstrate that embodied experiences are never ‘erased.’ Instead, although students find ways to articulate understanding that do not require movement, they nonetheless derive meaning from prior embodied activity. Young children exceed expected grade level understanding in part because their capability as embodied reasoners is privileged for learning. In addition to expanding liminal blends theory, we suggest implications for designing technology-enhanced environments and science learning. Across all audiences, findings suggest the importance of privileging an array of sensemaking resources often excluded from classrooms, and the importance of students mapping multiple representational forms to develop conceptual understanding of science phenomena. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

In this study, we seek to address the research gap by examining students’ perceptions of their learning and how they appropriate the epistemic tools for systems thinking in an issue-based unit on the regulation of e-cigarettes. We used semi-structured interviews from 33 students in a midwestern U.S. high school as our primary data. The results suggest that students in general held positive attitudes towards SSI-based learning experiences and found SSI work to be 1) relevant, 2) interesting, 3) promoting agency, and 4) beneficial for their science learning. Also, we found that students differed in how they appropriated the epistemic tools for systems thinking ranging from lack of appropriation, to appropriating surface features, and to appropriating epistemic purposes.

We explore diversity at a micro-cultural classroom level involving students’ emotional experiences and interactional practices as they engage with learning, which has received limited attention in naturalistic studies of STEM education, especially in East Asian cultures. In this study, we explore emotional experiences of students during a guided inquiry lesson in a Chinese primary school using an interpretive methodology informed by concepts of emotional energy, uniformity, and harmony. Emotional energy is an individual and collective experience of togetherness and solidarity emerging from successful social interaction. Uniformity and harmony are emotion-related concepts experienced in Confucian heritage cultures. The aims of this study are to explore Chinese students’ emotional experiences during a STEM inquiry lesson and to refine the conceptualization of emotional energy from Confucian cultural perspectives. Results: In a STEM inquiry, context knowledge about micro-cultural diversity and the interplay between Chinese emotional experiences and engagement with ideas are explored. Notions of uniformity and harmony are described through cultural practices as they relate to emotional energy. The study contributes to understanding the diversity of emotional energy as a student experience and social form of engagement, during a STEM inquiry activity in a Confucian heritage context. Conclusions: This study contributes to understandings of student experiences of uniformity, harmony, and variations to intensity of emotional energy during learning via STEM inquiry. Modifications to the conceptualization of emotional energy in STEM education are indicated.

In this paper, we examine how a professional learning community (PLC), comprised of middle school teachers and researchers, worked on the improvement of Ambitious Science Teaching (AST) practices and developed instructional practices and tools supporting model-based inquiry. This paper focuses on the first year of a 5-year research–practice partnership in which teachers and researchers routinely coplanned, cotaught, and codebriefed science lessons via improvement cycles. We conducted an analysis of teacher-designed tools, reflective talk, and classroom observations. All teachers engaged in increasingly sophisticated forms of AST practices over the year and began to use a similar tool to scaffold scientific modeling with students. Yet, there were two distinct variations that evolved with grade-level teams. One team developed a practice and tool supporting students’ final form articulation of ideas with models and the other team developed a practice and tools supporting the revision of models over a unit of instruction. We argue that both grade-level teams engaged in productive learning and that PLC benefited from having different perspectives on relatively similar practices for scaffolding students’ scientific modeling. On the basis of the findings, we propose three key components to a practice-based theory for how PLCs negotiate tools as a part of the improvement of teaching practices: anchoring improvement in a particular tool and practice, supporting variation in teacher learning and making teachers’ pedagogical reasoning explicit. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Teacher self-efficacy can also significantly affect student learning. Researchers investigated the effects of teacher professional development and integrated STEM curriculum development on teacher self-efficacy. Participants in the study included high school science and engineering technology teachers enrolled in a National Science Foundation–ITEST project called Teachers and Researchers Advancing Integrated Lessons in STEM (TRAILS). The TRAILS program sought to prepare teachers to integrate STEM content using engineering design, biomimicry, science inquiry, and 3D printing as pedagogical approaches. Teachers learned within a community of practice working alongside industry partners and college faculty. The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of the 70 h of professional development to train three cohorts of teachers over 3 years on teacher self-efficacy. The research design utilized a quasi-experimental nonequivalent control group approach, including an experimental group and an untreated control group. Results: Measurements on beliefs about teacher self-efficacy were collected on pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest survey assessments. Researchers analyzed the T-STEM survey results for teaching self-efficacy using the Wilcoxson signed-rank test for detecting significant differences. Science teachers showed a significant increase in teacher self-efficacy comparing the pretest and delayed posttest scores after TRAILS professional development and STEM lesson implementation (p =.001, effect size =.95). Additionally, significant differences between groups (science experimental vs science control group teachers) using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test were detected from pretest to posttest (p =.033, effect size =.46), posttest to delayed posttest (p =.029, effect size =.47), and pretest to delayed posttest (p =.005, effect size =.64). There were no significant differences detected in the control group. Engineering technology teachers showed no significant differences between the pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest self-efficacy scores. Conclusions: The results indicate the science teachers’ self-efficacy increased after professional development and after lesson implementation. Potential implications from this research suggest that the science teacher participants benefited greatly from learning within a community of practice, engaging in science practices, and using science knowledge to solve a real-world problem (engineering design). © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

Although sophisticated epistemological beliefs about science are important for attaining science literacy, students’ beliefs are difficult to assess. Previous work suggested that students’ epistemological beliefs about science are best assessed in the context of engagement in science practices, such as argumentation or inquiry. Results: In this paper, we propose a novel method for examining students’ epistemological beliefs about science situated in authentic science inquiry or their Epistemology in Authentic Science Inquiry (EASI). As a first step towards developing this assessment, we performed a novice/expert study to characterize practices within a simulated authentic science inquiry experience provided by Science Classroom Inquiry (SCI) simulations. Our analyses indicated that experts and novices, as defined by their experience with authentic science practices, had distinct practices in SCI simulations. For example, experts, as compared to novices, spent much of their investigations seeking outside information, which is consistent with novice/expert studies in engineering. We also observed that novice practices existed on a continuum, with some appearing more-or less expert-like. Furthermore, pre-test performance on established metrics of nature of science was predictive of practices within the simulation. Conclusions: Since performance on pre-test metrics of nature of science was predictive of practices, and since there were distinct expert or novice-like practices, it may be possible to use practices in simulated authentic science inquiry as a proxy for student’s epistemological beliefs. Given than novices existed on a continuum, this could facilitate the development of targeted science curriculum tailored to the needs of a particular group of students. This study indicates how educational technologies, such as simulated authentic science inquiry, can be harnessed to examine difficult to assess, but important, constructs such as epistemology. © 2019, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

In this paper, we claim the role that arts-based approaches can play in science education to break these biased views and understandings and generate a more motivating science learning experience. For that purpose, we analyse research conducted with students from two secondary schools in Barcelona participating in a science education project applying drama-based activities within an inquiry process with early-career researchers. More specifically, we explore students’ perceptions of science and their attitudes towards learning science at school and pursuing scientific careers. We then evaluate and discuss how the triad ‘researchers’ interaction–scientific inquiry–artistic creation’ can potentially challenge their storylines about science and bring science learning closer to them. Findings suggest that the evaluated approach contributed to progress in this direction through two mechanisms: creating new rapports with science by offering a creative, inclusive and interactive learning experience, and broadening students’ perceptions in terms of what implies to do science and who can do it. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

In particular, very limited research examines the intersection between the nature of science (NOS) and special education (SPED). To address this gap, the study investigated 18 preservice SPED teachers’ NOS plans and instructions in a methods course, as well as their perceptions of the role of NOS and its relevance to SEN. The data sources included written reflections, interviews, lesson plans and microteaching during class. Most preservice teachers planned and implemented NOS lessons within inquiry within the class, although NOS was not required. This finding represents a strong outcome as participants were non-science majors and were provided only a short period of NOS intervention. Importantly, the preservice SPED teachers considered NOS to be relevant to SEN, considering students’ unique ideas and different ways of thinking. This provided initial evidence that preservice SPED teachers may view teaching NOS as a way to highlight students’ differences in ideas/perspectives, supporting their contributions to science.

In response, researchers and curriculum developers designed and studied Virtual Engineering Internships (VEIs) to engage students in engineering and science practices outlined by the NGSS, and alleviate some of the logistical and conceptual burden for teachers unfamiliar with engineering instruction. Nevertheless, the VEIs still require striking shifts in the way teaching and learning happens in middle school science classrooms. In this exploratory study we sought to understand whether and how teachers participating in a curriculum pilot project (n = 26) interacted with the VEIs in ways that helped them carry out pedagogical shifts called for by the NGSS, and to identify curricular features that may have supported these shifts. Findings suggest that teachers leveraged and modified the VEIs to support student engagement in engineering practices and real-world problem-solving, which suggests the potential of the curriculum to catalyse deep pedagogical shifts called for by the NGSS.

Engagement with this challenge has the potential to lead to the provision of interfaces that allow students to access these resources and become independent learners. It is therefore important to identify and evaluate the features of such interfaces to calibrate and respond to individual student needs. In this context, the quality of differentiated support for learning, referred to as scaffolding, is established as paramount to the design and structure of online environments. In this study, the instructional design referred to as predict, observe, explain and evaluate (POEE), informed by constructivist theories of learning, to implement multiple scaffolding strategies is described. The POEE scaffolding strategy was applied in the creation of two inquiry learning modules. Student engagement with these inquiry modules in a self-directed online environment was explored to identify critical elements of the scaffolding. The findings of this study, based on students' interactions and engagement with the learning modules, enabled the conceptualisation of a multimodal scaffolding strategy for self-directed inquiry. We propose that the recommendations from the implementation of these scaffolded learning modules can represent exemplars illustrative of an enriched instructional design paradigm to support students’ independent study in blended environments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

To address this issue, this study proposed a light-weight inquiry activity that can be pragmatically implemented in regular classrooms based on the minimalism principle and the teacher-led collaboration principle. Data gathered from 49 middle school students indicated that after learning in the light-weight inquiry condition, students demonstrated significant enhancements in the target science knowledge. In particular, the students in the light-weight inquiry condition displayed significantly higher levels of enhancement in scientific literacy than those who learned in the traditional lecturing condition. Furthermore, the students perceived a higher level of deep motivation and strategy but a lower level of memorizing science facts and calculating and practicing when they learned in the light-weight inquiry condition. The proposed pedagogical design demonstrated a positive impact on the learning of science knowledge, scientific literacy, and conceptions of learning and approaches to learning science. However, an unexpected effect was also observed, showing that the light-weight inquiry activity might also trigger surface motivation reflecting students' fear of failure in tests and the orientation to meet external expectations.

Increased access to computers and other devices has shifted the landscape of the classroom, increasing students' screen-time, as technology infused lessons replace other learning experiences. Amid this context, our research team created a serious educational game (SEG) designed for elementary science learners. Previous studies have linked serious gameplay to learning gains and changes in attitudes, yet the rigor of the studies often underwhelms, as the studies lack an adequate sample size, detailed student data, or quality comparison groups. These limitations are compounded in the study of science learning in elementary schools, due to structural difficulties and student variability that impede the implementation of this type of experimentation. This research attends to this knowledge gap, as our team conducted two quasi-experimental studies to explore the learning gains associated with Virtual Vet, a SEG designed to address the fundamental science concepts associated with the human body systems and the subsequent effect of diabetes and obesity related illnesses on the given body systems. In Study 1, students (n = 232) were randomly assigned to play Virtual Vet or participate in guided inquiry lessons that addressed the same objectives. Our study found that students in the game condition outperformed the non-game condition. Based on this finding, we designed Study 2 to compare learning outcomes associated with two conditions: students play only Virtual Vet or students play Virtual Vet and they participate in the guided inquiry activities, which doubled the instructional time for this group. Students (n = 166) were assigned to one of the conditions and we found no significant increase in learning gains for the students who participated in both activities. These results indicate that well-designed SEGs powerfully facilitate and support science learning in elementary settings. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

One approach to supporting collaborative science inquiry is through problem-based learning (PBL). However, there are two key challenges in scaffolding collaborative inquiry learning in technology rich environments. First, it is unclear how we might understand the impact of scaffolds that address multiple functions (e.g., to support inquiry and argumentation). Second, scaffolds take different forms, further complicating how to coordinate the forms and functions of scaffolds to support effective collaborative inquiry. To address these issues, we identify two functions that needed to be scaffolded, the PBL inquiry cycle and accountable talk. We then designed predefined hard scaffolds and just-in-time soft scaffolds that target the regulation of collaborative inquiry processes and accountable talk. Drawing on a mixed method approach, we examine how middle school students from a rural school engaged with Crystal Island: EcoJourneys for two weeks (N=45). Findings indicate that hard scaffolds targeting the PBL inquiry process and soft scaffolds that targeted accountable talk fostered engagement in these processes. Although the one-to-one mapping between form and function generated positive results, additional soft scaffolds were also needed for effective engagement in collaborative inquiry and that these soft scaffolds were often contingent on hard scaffolds. Our findings have implications for how we might design the form of scaffolds across multiple functions in game-based learning environments. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Good learning strategy guides are essential for successful inquiry learning, and the question-posing strategy has been acknowledged as a type of high-level cognitive strategy that plays an important role in facilitating students' knowledge integration in the inquiry learning process. However, question posing seems challenging for many students and may lead to heavy cognitive load when appropriate scaffolding is not available. To solve this problem, the present research imported a concept mapping knowledge representation model as an auxiliary strategy for question-posing activities based on the research finding that visual knowledge representations are conducive to high-order thinking. It also developed a ubiquitous learning system which integrated multilevel concept mapping and question-posing strategy guidance to investigate the application effects of this learning model. A quasi-experimental design was applied, and an experiment was conducted to measure 5th graders’ learning of a plant unit of the natural science curriculum. Students in the experimental group learned with the proposed ubiquitous learning system based on the multilevel concept mapping and question-posing approach, while those in the control group learned with the ubiquitous learning system based on the question-posing approach. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group from the perspectives of learning achievement and question-posing performance, but no significance was found in their cognitive load, meta-cognitive awareness, and science learning strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

We use Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) to explore how students from highest- and lowest-performing profiles characterize the inquiry-based science instruction they experience. We then use cluster analysis to compare patterns in inquiry-based instruction reported by students in the highest-performing profiles in each country and examine relationships between inquiry-based and other instructional practices. Findings from our analysis reveal fundamental differences in the frequency and nature of inquiry-based instruction reported by students associated with the highest and lowest levels of science achievement.

IBT has positioned itself as one of the most recommended “active” methodologies for developing intellectual autonomy and complex thought processes, whereas school climate is considered to be a protective factor that helps mitigate adverse conditions and has a positive impact on teaching and learning. This study investigates the relationship between IBT and school climate with the academic performance of Colombian students in the PISA 2015 test. Results: Using a two-level Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM), the results show a negative association between IBT and students’ scientific performance in the test. However, results show a positive association between IBT and students’ self-reported critical thinking skills. Results also show that school climate is a positive moderating factor on learning. Contextual factors such as the student’s grade level at the time of sitting for the PISA test, gender, and socioeconomic characteristics are strong predictors of science achievement in PISA. Conclusions: These results reveal the need for additional research on the effect of the so-called active methodologies and school context on student learning. Regarding IBT, it seems that its influence is greater on student’s perception and motivation, than in acquisition of scientific knowledge. Positive school climate is a protective factor that can help to improve student learning. In Colombia, the quality of students’ educational outcomes has largely been attributed to their socioeconomic background. However, the results of this study show that, although students’ and schools’ socioeconomic characteristics continue to be strong predictors of academic performance, teaching practices can have an even larger impact. © 2020, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

To comprehend the complex systems underlying these issues, students need systems thinking skills. However, in science education, a uniform delineation of systems thinking across contexts has yet to be established. While there seems to be consensus on a number of key skills from a theoretical perspective, it remains uncertain whether it is possible to distinguish levels of systems thinking, and if so, how they would be determined. In this study, we investigated the impact of the specifics of a system on the skills and levels of systems thinking. We administered a 36-item multiple-choice test to 196 Grade 5 and 6 students. For our analysis, we followed a quantitative approach, applying a systems thinking model that incorporates the latest insights on the levels and skills of systems thinking in geography to the context of ecology. By following an Item Response Theory approach, we confirmed a set of systems thinking skills that are necessary to understand complex systems in ecology: identifying system organization, analyzing system behavior, and system modeling. We examined whether individual skill levels can be distinguished to determine whether a system's general principle or system-specific features cause difficulty for students. Our results indicate that system specifics, such as type of relation within ecosystems (e.g., predator–prey), appear to determine the formation of levels. Students struggled most with the difference between basic, direct cause-and-effect relationships and indirect effects. Once they understood the relevance of indirect relationships in moderately complex systems, a further increase in complexity caused little additional difficulty. Accordingly, we suggest that systems thinking should be examined from a variety of perspectives. To promote interdisciplinary learning, a systems thinking model that defines key commonalities across fields while leaving space for system specifics is needed. © 2020 The Authors.

However, little research has systematically explored the role of a strong agency-oriented focus on understanding of complex, dynamic ecological systems. This study analyzed seventh graders' (n = 216) explanations of a complex ecological scenario. The findings show that students were more likely to generate agentive than nonagentive explanations and students who adopted an agentive framing were least likely to understand the complex causal dynamics of two environmental scenarios, eutrophication in a pond and acid rain in a forest. Furthermore, students' initial inclination toward agency-oriented explanation on the assessment was predictive of their performance on a postassessment following an instructional opportunity to learn about ecosystems dynamics; a strong agency orientation corresponded to less complex interpretations of the dynamics of the ecosystems.

Based on other collective inquiry frameworks for knowledge building, we propose three interconnected components: the inquiry process, the collective process, and technological support to facilitate and study teachers’ design practices in technological environments. We explain the framework with examples of implemented technologies and present empirical results of three cases; two High schools and a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). Results inform further how our framework can be implemented in practice and its required supports to facilitate knowledge building for inquiry communities of teachers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

In this paper, we explore how a Bifocal Modelling implementation supported learning outcomes related to both content and metamodeling knowledge, focusing on the role of designing models. Our study consisted of three conditions implemented with a total of 69 9th grade high-school students. The first and second classes were assigned two implementation modes of BMF: with and without a model design module. The third condition, employed as a control, consisted of a class that received instruction in the school’s traditional approach. Our results indicate that students participating in both BMF implementations demonstrated improved content knowledge and a better understanding of metamodeling. However, only the ‘BMF-with-design’ group improved significantly in both content and metamodeling knowledge. Our qualitative analyses indicate that both BMF groups designed detailed models that included scientific explanations. However only students who engaged in the model design component: (1) completed a detailed model displaying molecular interaction; and (2) developed a critical perspective about models. We discuss the implications of those results for teaching scientific science concepts and metamodeling knowledge. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The participants were 39 Grade 5 students who were collectively pursuing ideas and inquiry for knowledge advance using Knowledge Forum (KF) while studying a unit on electricity; they also reflected on the epistemic nature of their discourse. A comparison class of 22 students, taught by the same teacher, studied the same unit using the school’s established scientific investigation method. We hypothesised that engaging students in idea-driven and theory-building discourse, as well as scaffolding them to reflect on the epistemic nature of their discourse, would help them understand their own scientific collaborative discourse as a theory-building process, and therefore understand scientific inquiry as an idea-driven and theory-building process. As hypothesised, we found that students engaged in knowledge-building discourse and reflection outperformed comparison students in scientific epistemology and science learning, and that students’ understanding of collaborative discourse predicted their post-test scientific epistemology and science learning. To further understand the epistemic change process among knowledge-building students, we analysed their KF discourse to understand whether and how their epistemic practice had changed after epistemic reflection. The implications on ways of promoting epistemic change are discussed. © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Data consist of 10 videotaped and transcribed lessons with 14-year-old students (N = 26) in Sweden. The analysis focused instances where meaning of representations was negotiated. Findings indicate that continuity is established in multiple ways, for example, as the use of metaphors articulated as an interlanguage expression that enables the students (and the teacher) to maintain the conversation and explain pressing issues in ways that support of the end-in-view of the immediate action. Continuity is also established between every day and scientific registers and between organisation levels as well as between the smaller parts and the whole system. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Using concept maps, it sought to find an external way of representing how students organize their ideas about the human body system in their minds. We conducted a qualitative analysis of four concept maps created by each student throughout the 3-year learning process, which allowed us to identify that student’s systems thinking skills and the development of those skills over time. The improvement trajectories of the students were defined according to three central characteristics of complex systems: (a) hierarchy, (b) homeostasis and (c) dynamism. A comparative analysis of all of our students’ individual trajectories together revealed four typical learning patterns, each of which reflects a different form of development for systems thinking: “from the structure to the process level”, “from macro to micro level”, “from the cellular level to the organism level,” and “development in complexity of homeostasis mechanisms”. Despite their differences, each of these models developed over time from simpler structures, which evolved as they connected with more complex system aspects, and each indicates advancement in the student’s systems thinking. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus"

In the research, the gifted students consisted of 275 boys, 128 girls, and additional 80 girls who were admitted to the gifted programme through affirmative action (AA). To assess these young students’ scientific thinking skills, also referred to as science practices, open-ended questions of case-based questionnaires were developed. The investigated scientific thinking skills were question posing, explanation, graphing, inquiry, and metacognition. Analysis of the students’ responses revealed that gifted girls who entered the programmes through AA performed at the same level as the other gifted students. We found significant differences between the three research groups in question posing and graphing skills. We suggest increasing gender-fairness by revising the standard national testing system to include case-based narratives followed by open-ended questions that assess gifted students’ scientific thinking skills. This may diminish the gender inequity expressed by the different number of girls and boys accepted to the gifted programmes. We show that open-ended tools for analysing students’ scientific thinking might better serve both research and practice by identifying gifted girls and boys equally well. © 2018 The Author(s).

The specific focus of this work was on understanding how teachers used classroom dialogue to create an environment that supports the use of multiple online text-based resources as part of the process of doing science. Data collection for this study occurred in the 6th grade classrooms of two teachers in a Midwestern school district. Each of the teachers taught three science classes for a total of 150 students. A test of students’ content knowledge of physics was used in order to evaluate students’ understanding of the physics concepts targeted in the curriculum. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that the students from one teacher's classes performed significantly better on the physics test than the students of the other teacher (p <.05). To qualitatively investigate the differences between the whole class dialogue used by the two teachers, teachers’ interactions with students as they prepared them to engage in research with the multiple texts were coded.

A measurement instrument is required which is suitable both for supporting students and for the evaluation of methodical-didactic measures. Such a tool is theoretically anchored in an empirically validated geography-didactic and cognition-psychological competence model, providing a differentiated representation of both the internal structure of a competency and the proficiency levels. The starting point of this foundation was the development of a normative-theoretically derived model of geographic system competence. Its empirical validation was performed in different phases aimed at operationalising the competence model by means of test problems. In order to analyse the factor structure of the theoretical model, various item response models were estimated. The item levels of difficulty expected in the competence model were related to the empirical levels of difficulty and predicted by means of ordinary least squares regression to verify the model for proficiency levels. The two-dimensional competence model – with the two dimensions ‘system organisation and behaviour’ and ‘system-adequate intention to act’ – exhibits a better fit in reference to the model fit criteria than the one-dimensional and three-dimensional models. The correlations between the expected and empirical item difficulties are positive. Items that should be more difficult according to the competence model are actually shown to be more difficult. These findings suggest the reliability and validity of this new measurement instrument for diagnosing and promoting geographical system competence. It has to be implemented in practice as the next step. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Using a randomized cluster design (125 teachers and 2,694 students in 4th—5th grades) that met the What Works Clearinghouse standards without reservations, teacher learning was conceptualized using four outcomes. Data were analyzed using standard single-level multiple regression models and possible mediation models for the teacher outcomes were considered using piecewise multiple regression and path analytic approaches. Treatment group teachers experienced greater increases in content knowledge, views of science inquiry, beliefs about reform-based teaching, and teaching self-efficacy than comparison group teachers. The findings indicate that what teachers learn from the combination of professional development and teaching with educative curriculum varies according to what their knowledge and beliefs are on entering the experience. Surprisingly, high entry-level self-efficacy was associated not only with lower learning gains for the teachers, but also for their students. Finally, teachers' space science learning and that of their students are implicated as mediators of the positive effect of the professional development and educative curriculum enactment on teacher beliefs about reform science teaching.

Using the symbolic interactionist perspective that meaning is constructed as individuals interact with one another, we examined how student groups enrolled in an undergraduate general chemistry course developed sociochemical norms that influenced individual student understanding of chemical concepts. Sociochemical norms refer to the normative aspects of classroom microculture that regulate discourse on what counts as a table chemical justification and explanation. We describe how these sociochemical normative ideas were developed based on observational research and recordings of the student groups as they engaged in classroom discourse. Results: Our analysis showed that students routinely developed chemistry-driven criteria within and across groups to explain the nature of dissolving ionic solids in water. Moreover, resultant sociochemical norms led to shifts in student understanding and the ways in which students reasoned about the causes of chemical phenomena under study. Conclusions: Our results indicate that group dialog influenced individual student conceptions of ionic compounds in solution and highlight the need to engage students in instructional activities that not only engage them in the multiple ways of representing chemical knowledge but also making public their views and participating in classroom discourse. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

However, scientific language is typically used with the goal of being concise and precise, which allows those who regularly participate in scientific discourse communities to learn from each other and build upon existing scientific knowledge. One essential component of science language is the academic vocabulary that characterises it. This mixed-methods study investigates middle school students’ (N = 59) growth in academic vocabulary as it relates to their teacher’s instructional practices that supported academic language development. Students made significant gains in their production of general academic words, t(57) = 2.32, p =.024 and of discipline-specific science words, t(57) = 3.01, p =.004 in science writing. Results from the qualitative strand of this inquiry contextualised the students’ learning of academic vocabulary as it relates to their teacher’s instructional practices and intentions as well as the students’ perceptions of their learning environment. These qualitative findings reveal that both the students and their teacher articulated that the teacher’s intentional use of resources supported students’ academic vocabulary growth.

In biology lessons, experiments involve creative thinking and open discovery; however, they still require some degree of instructional guidance. The right balance between discovery learning and instructional guidance depends substantially on students’ prior knowledge. Students with low prior knowledge in particular might have difficulties with conducting and understanding experiments. Incremental scaffolds might be a valuable tool to meditate between pure discovery and strong guidance while simultaneously taking learners’ individual knowledge and skills into account. In the current study, we examined the effects of incremental scaffolds (IncSc), no scaffolds (NoSc), and worked-out examples (WoEx) on students’ knowledge acquisition while doing inquiry-based experimentation with a special focus on students with low prior knowledge. In a pre-posttest design, 193 students (M                             age                             = 13.02 ± 0.81 years) participated in a four-hour teaching unit on animals’ overwintering strategies.

Specifically speaking, these gaps ranged from addressing certain educational contexts to focusing on statistical significance only in some of earlier research.

It helps learners to develop their ability to work in complex and unpredictable environments making them more critical thinkers and agentic learners. Although mobile technology is a suitable support for this learning process, there is a lack of practical strategies for educational practitioners to enact the right balance between enabling agency and supporting the students through the mobile technology. Thus, we conducted a literature review that analyzed 62 studies on mobile inquiry-based learning. The analysis focused on the level of agency supported by mobile technology. This review study provided two main results. The first result is a two-layer classification –with five types and twelve subtypes– of the most common mobile activities used in inquiry-based learning. The types and subtypes are: 1) Direct instruction formed by 1a) location guidance, 1b) procedural guidance and 1c) metacognitive guidance, 2) Access to content formed by 2a) fixed and 2b) dynamic content, 3) Data collection that consists of 3a) cooperative and 3b) collaborative data collection, 4) Peer-to-peer communication formed by 4a) asynchronous and 4b) synchronous social communications and 5) Contextual support that includes 5a) augmented experience, 5b) immersive experience and 5c) adaptive feedback. The second result consists of an analytical framework –based on six dimensions– to assess the level of agency supported by the different types of mobile activities. The learners' agency dimensions are: 1) Goals, 2) Content, 3) Actions, 4) Strategies, 5) Reflection and 6) Monitoring. Finally, the review presents insights on how this analytical framework can be used by educational practitioners to identify mobile activities that effectively balance learners’ agency with mobile technology. © 2017 The Authors","Article","Scopus"

During open inquiry, teachers often experience difficulties in balancing support and transferring responsibility to pupils’ own learning. To facilitate teachers in guiding open inquiry, we developed hard and soft scaffolds. The hard scaffolds consisted of documents with explanations and/or exercises regarding difficult parts of the inquiry process. The soft scaffolds included explicit references to and additional explanations of the hard scaffolds. We investigated how teacher implementation of these scaffolds contributed to pupils’ self-directed learning during open inquiry. Four classes of pupils, aged 10–11, were observed while they conducted an inquiry lesson module of about 10 lessons in their classrooms. Data were acquired via classroom observations, audio recordings, and interviews with teachers and pupils. The results show that after the introduction of the hard scaffolds by the teacher, pupils were able and willing to apply them to their investigations. Combining hard scaffolds with additional soft scaffolding promoted pupils’ scientific understanding and contributed to a shared guidance of the inquiry process by the teacher and her pupils. Our results imply that the effective use of scaffolds is an important element to be included in teacher professionalisation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The divide between scientists’ perceptions of science and the perceptions held by those who study science is in this context problematic. Even so, this remains a sorely understudied area. The aim of the study was to identify pragmatic ways that hold the potential to facilitate integration of scholarly studies of scientific knowledge production with experientially based knowledge held by scientists to support the teaching of epistemic knowledge content to undergraduate science students. Earlier studies suggest that trust building is a central component. Our exploratory case study focuses on instructor perceptions and is based on informal interviews, participatory observation and surveys with instructors in a first-year undergraduate science course under revision. We identified the following central components as central to successful navigation of the divide between the scientific practice and science studies: Explicit formulation of learning objectives tied to epistemic knowledge acquisition; Conscious attention to vocabulary that triggers scientists’ aversion to science studies; Careful selection of historic and contemporary cases; and Systematic scaffolding of course activities. The conclusion regarding a common vocabulary stands out: by ridding our instructions from the vocabulary that caused concern among science instructors we succeeded in engaging them in conversations with students about the knowledge-producing process and challenge the view of science as characterised by facts and truths, rather than a form of scholarly inquiry that aims to produce knowledge about the natural world. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The focus on curiosity as individual differences variable was motivated by the importance of curiosity in science education, and uncertainty being central to both the definition of curiosity and the inquiry-learning environment. Curiosity was assessed with the Underwater Exploration game (Jirout, J., & Klahr, D. (2012). Children's scientific curiosity: In search of an operational definition of an elusive concept. Developmental Review, 32, 125–160. doi:10.1016/j.dr.2012.04.002), and inquiry-based learning with the newly developed Scientific Discovery task, which focuses on the principle of designing informative experiments. Structure of the inquiry-learning environment was manipulated by explaining this principle or not. As intelligence relates to learning and possibly curiosity, it was taken into account. Results showed that children's curiosity was positively related to their knowledge acquisition, but not to their quality of exploration. For low intelligent children, environment structure positively affected their quality of exploration, but not their knowledge acquisition. There was no interaction between curiosity and environment structure. These results support the existence of two distinct inquiry-based learning processes–the designing of experiments, on the one hand, and the reflection on performed experiments, on the other–and link children's curiosity to the latter process. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

In a quasi-experimental pre-test–post-test design, two paper-and-pencil tests and three performance assessments were used to examine the acquisition and transfer of inquiry skills. Additionally, questionnaires were used to measure metacognitive skills. The results of a multilevel analysis controlling for pre-tests, general cognitive ability, age, gender and grade level indicated that explicit instruction facilitates the acquisition of science inquiry skills. Specifically on the performance assessment with an unfamiliar topic, students in the explicit condition outperformed students of both the implicit and baseline condition. Therefore, this study provides a strong argument for including an explicit teaching method for developing inquiry skills in primary science education. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

One way to achieve this goal is to use inquiry-learning activities that embed the use of science process skills. We investigated the influence of scientific reasoning skills (i.e. conceptual and procedural knowledge of the control-of-variables strategy) on students’ conceptual learning gains in physics during an inquiry-learning activity. Eighth graders (n = 189) answered research questions about variables that influence the force of electromagnets and the brightness of light bulbs by designing, running, and interpreting experiments. We measured knowledge of electricity and electromagnets, scientific reasoning skills, and cognitive skills (analogical reasoning and reading ability). Using structural equation modelling we found no direct effects of cognitive skills on students’ content knowledge learning gains; however, there were direct effects of scientific reasoning skills on content knowledge learning gains. Our results show that cognitive skills are not sufficient; students require specific scientific reasoning skills to learn science content from inquiry activities. Furthermore, our findings illustrate that what students learn during guided inquiry activities becomes visible when we examine both the skills used during inquiry learning and the process of knowledge construction. The implications of these findings for science teaching and research are discussed. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Other work has focused on instruction while acknowledging the existence of other ways of understanding complex systems, but less emphasis has been on examining the knowledge structures within these intermediate ways of understanding. This study takes a microgenetic approach to examining student’s explanations for the behavior of complex systems. Using the Knowledge-in-Pieces epistemological perspective, the analysis documents a continuity of reasoning patterns across less prototypically centralized and more prototypically decentralized (a more sophisticated causality) explanations while explaining the movement of sand dunes. The first analysis examines 31 interviews and shows that many reflected a general reasoning pattern that encompassing some combination of an initial centralized explanation, a final decentralized explanation, and transitional explanations. A second analysis examines a single student’s reasoning pattern and finds that the activation of relevant intuitive knowledge pieces (p-prims) and transitional explanations function as threads of continuity across the continuum of reasoning patterns. These findings suggest that students are able to exhibit a continuity of reasoning patterns across centralized to decentralized causality and are able to access productive intuitive knowledge about complex systems that are applicable to both the macro and micro levels of sand dune movement. Implications suggest that future research investigate these transitional explanations along with the mechanisms of shifting explanations that can account for this robust continuum. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus"

Yet, little is known about the effect of guidance on attitudes and behaviours, its interaction with student attributes, and transfer of impact once guidance is removed. We address these gaps in the context of an interactive Physics simulation on electric circuits (https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/circuit-construction-kit-dc). 49 students in the Non-Directive condition received a set of goals to focus their inquiry, in addition to implicit support built into the simulation. 48 students in the Directive condition received, in addition to these, also detailed directions and prompts. Log-file analysis found that directive support led to more formal testing and less exploration. Clustering identified two groups of learners: one with higher incoming knowledge (Higher Knowledge), the other with higher incoming perceptions of competence and control (Higher PoCC). Working with the simulation improved knowledge and attitudes across cluster groups, so that prior differences all but disappeared. With regard to guidance, adding directive support improved knowledge gains for the Higher Knowledge group, yet suppressed their attitudinal growth. The same support had no effect on knowledge gains for the Higher PoCC group, yet it boosted their attitudinal growth. A transfer activity, where directive support was no longer available, found that impact on attitudes carried forward, yet impacts on behaviours and knowledge were short-lived. Overall, the study highlights the complex interaction between guidance and student attributes. For some, supporting short-term knowledge gains may inadvertenly lead to longer term negative impact on attitudes towards inquiry. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus"

The KF embedded assessment tools, the Analytical Toolkit and Applet, showed increased KF participation and connectedness during the year. Regression analysis showed that KF participation predicted conceptual understanding for both classes. Analyses of e-portfolios revealed that the students adopted nine reflective strategies in knowledge building, and that reflective metadiscourse strategies involving metacognitive and collective processes were related with deeper conceptual understanding. Analyses of online discourse threads further showed that metadiscourse involving collective processes was associated with higher levels of knowledge advances. Both classes showed improvement and the KBP class outperformed the KBR class on KF participation, metadiscourse processes and conceptual understanding. This study has theoretical implications advancing the idea of metadiscourse, discourse about discourse, for enriching research on knowledge building and computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL).

Using narrative inquiry, participants generated detailed accounts of their informal and formal STEM learning experiences. Critical race methodology informed this research to portray the dynamic and complex experiences of girls of color, whose stories have historically been silenced and misrepresented. The data sources for this qualitative study included individual interviews, student reflection journals, samples of student work, and researcher memos, which were triangulated to produce six robust counterstories. Excerpts of the counterstories are presented in this article. The major findings of this research revealed that I AM STEM ignited an interest in STEM learning through field trips and direct engagement in scientific phenomena that allowed the girls to become agentic in continuing their engagement in STEM activities throughout the year. This call to awaken the voices of Black girls to speak casts light on their experiences and challenges as STEM learners—from their perspectives. The findings confirm that when credence and counterspaces are given to Black girls, they are poised to reveal their luster toward STEM learning. This study provided a space for Black girls to reflect on their STEM learning experiences, formulate new understandings, and make connections between the informal and formal learning environments within the context of their everyday lives, thus offering a more holistic approach to STEM learning that occurs across settings and over a lifetime. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Interaction ritual analysis of the focal student's interactions with peers during small-group science investigations at the microlevel (tenths of a second) and in real-time revealed that positive interaction rituals failed to form at first. Over a period of 6 months, his persistent use of nonverbal and verbal participation strategies, and opportunities to engage diverse communicative resources, resulted in higher levels of synchrony with his classmates and successful interactions in the language of instruction. The findings present novel information about the nuances of the silent, embodied participation of language learners in inquiry-oriented instruction.

Research in inquiry-based practical work (IBPW) has focused, for example, on aspects of the strategy itself, on teacher professional development, and on classroom teaching and learning based on the strategy. However, the question of the extent to which teaching practices linked to the implementation of practical work are actually inquiry-based, was still to be answered. To draw on the answer to this question to inform professional development practice and research, we focused on the case of physical sciences classrooms in two resource-constrained South African schools. In this regard, we used a conceptual framework based on the Interconnected Model of Teachers' Professional Growth and including a framework of teaching practices. In the data collection, we used a multimethod case study approach and to analyze the data, we combined the inductive and deductive approaches in thematic analysis. The results show that in the initiation, planning, and classroom implementation phases of practical work, many of the teaching practices of participants were inconsistent with inquiry-based teaching and learning, although some other practices were consistent with this type of teaching and learning. At the same time, some of the consistent practices were at a rather low level of implementation. We have discussed the theory-, practice-, and research-based implications of these results, in relation to the implementation of IBPW in resource-constrained physical sciences classrooms in South Africa and internationally. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The data included screen-capture videos from a technology-enhanced learning environment and audio recordings of discussions between students. We performed a thematic analysis based on the phases of inquiry-based learning (IBL). The thematic analysis was complemented by a content analysis, in which we analysed whether the utilisation of technological tools was on a deep-level, surface-level, or non-existent basis. Student participation was measured in terms of frequency of contributions as well as in terms of impact. We visualised the sequence of the face-to-face interactions of two groups of five students by focussing on the temporal aspects of IBL, technology enhancement and collaborative learning. First, instead of the amount of time the groups spent on a specific IBL phase, the between-group differences in the most frequent transitions between the IBL phases determined their differential progress in the CIBL process. Second, we found that the transitions were triggered by the groups’ ways of utilising technological tools either at the deep level or at the surface level. Finally, we found that the level of participation inequity remained stable throughout the CIBL process. As a result, only some of the members of the groups played a role in the most frequent transitions.

Both script conditions began with the teacher modeling each inquiry skill at the plenary level. After the plenary session, students in the Plenary–Individual–Small Group (PISG) classroom script first worked individually before working in small groups, whereas students in the Plenary–Small Group–Individual (PSGI) condition first worked in small groups before working individually. Overall, 61 students (grades 6–9) participated in a quasi-experimental study: 10 groups of three to four students in each condition. We coded all 20 groups’ discourse. Descriptive findings showed no statistical significance in both script conditions. Case studies of the two groups’ discourse in each experimental condition showed that occurrences of high-level grounding and high-level testing processes led to more occurrences of high-level inquiry processes in the PISG script condition. Excerpts of students’ work at the individual level in both conditions illustrated how the script sequence shaped the discourse moves at the small group level.

In terms of driving in the simulation, the students learned to drive in ways that reduced congestion in traffic by decreasing lane and speed changes, and keeping their speed down. Even though there was no explicit teaching, half of the students learned that car speed distribution alone can generate traffic jams with no additional causes; and, keeping a safe following distance from the next driver increases everyone’s speed. Our study suggests that the learning environment partially met both the overarching design goal of constrained discovery and the specific content goal of systems reasoning. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus"

A large-scale study was conducted in Singaporean schools to establish the norm of Singaporean students’ new media literacy. This was based on a conceptual framework of new media literacy (Lin et al., 2013). The development and validation of the measurement instrument can be found in Lee et al. (2015). This paper focuses on findings from the main study. A total of 4577 students, between 10 and 15 years old, from 52 schools participated in the study. That is, one-seventh of the Singaporean schools were involved in this survey study. To our best knowledge, there has not been any other study like this one carried out within the Asian context. Therefore, the findings offer valuable insights in theorizing new media and media literacy as well as for policy-makers and educators in countries with similar new media ecologies. Implications of this study suggest that it is possible to achieve gender equality for new media literary education. They also point to a new direction of inquiry by exploring new media literacy from a second language learning perspective. © 2018","Article","Scopus"

The study aims to analyze FB group shares and prospective teachers’ views in order to investigate the reflections of the teaching process that took place within the Community Services Practices course. The study was carried out with prospective teachers enrolled in the Computer Education Instructional Technology (CEIT) Teacher Training program. Its implementation entailed a case study with 92 prospective teachers, and the FB group was used as one of the main elements of the course in which students shared weekly discussion topics, social activities, and community service projects for 12 weeks. In this context, data were gathered via an analysis of the learning environment screenshots from the FB group. Furthermore, quantitative data gathered through multiple-choice, as well as open-ended questions, were presented with reference to frequencies and percentages, whereas qualitative data were presented in the form of themes, codes, and quotations. The study attempted to interpret the findings through the ‘Community of Inquiry’ (CoI) framework. In this vein, FB's social network supported a teaching presence for both the instructors and the students and enabled them to share responsibility for the teaching process. Moreover, the communication and socialization characteristics of FB directly contributed to the social presence of the learning groups created through this media. While the practices implemented over FB contributed to increased social sensitivity and awareness among prospective teachers, low-quality shares and irrelevant discussions in the FB group had negative effects on the learning environment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

These tasks have great potential to direct the implementation of an inquiry-based approach, as teachers rely heavily on the use of existing instructional materials in most K-12 classrooms. However, these tasks would not actually take effect unless they could accomplish the mission of assisting in the achievement of the educational goals of an inquiry-based approach, for which it is necessary to assess the design quality of inquiry-based tasks in textbooks. Content analysis is an effective way to evaluate the design quality of textbooks. This study adopted the instrument–the Inquiry-based Tasks Analysis Inventory (ITAI), which fits the purpose and has strong reliability and validity–to analyse the inquiry-based tasks in current high school biology textbooks in Mainland China. The results show that (1) some of the inquiry-based tasks separate the inquiry process from scientific content, (2) current textbooks do not present balanced dispositions to use inquiry process skills, and (3) inquiry-based tasks in current textbooks do not reflect a proper understanding about scientific inquiry. The findings call for revisions of inquiry-based tasks in textbooks and indicate the ambiguous understanding about inquiry that may be held by the textbook authors. What is more, the problems revealed by this study are very similar to those found in previous studies in other regions, which highlights the need for continuous attention to the evaluation of inquiry-based tasks in textbooks. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

While such activities have been shown to support science learning, difficulties building and using computational models are common and reduce learning benefits. Drawing from Collins and Ferguson (Educ Psychol 28(1):25–42, 1993), we conjecture that a major cause for such difficulties is a misalignment between the epistemic games (modeling strategies) learners play, and the epistemic forms (model types) a given modeling environment is designed to support. To investigate, we analyzed data from a study in which ten groups of U. S. fifth graders (n = 28) worked to create stop motion animations and agent-based computational models (ABMs) to discover the particulate nature of matter. Content analyses revealed that (1) groups that made progress—that is, that developed increasingly mechanistic, explanatory models—focused on elements, movement, and interactions when developing their models, a strategy well-aligned with both animation and ABM; (2) groups that did not make progress focused on sequences of phases, a strategy well-aligned with animation but not with ABM; and (3) struggling groups progressed when they received guidance about modeling strategies, but not when they received guidance about model content. We present summary analyses and three vignettes to illustrate these findings, and share implications for research and curricular design. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Article","Scopus"

This mixed-methods study investigated how interactive dynamic and static visualizations embedded in web-based inquiry instruction can support ELs and non-ELs in developing a coherent understanding of energy and matter transformations in life science. A total of 331 seventh-grade ELs and non-ELs were randomly assigned to a dynamic or a static visualization condition. During inquiry instruction, students in the dynamic group explored interactive dynamic visualizations of energy and matter transformations; students in the static group explored static, yet otherwise equivalent, interactive visualizations. The results show that, while both forms of visualizations were beneficial for students, dynamic visualizations had significant advantages for improving all students’ understanding of the target concepts. Our analyses of video data revealed that ELs and non-ELs in the dynamic condition engaged in more talk turns to interpret the scientific phenomena using both visual and textual representations, whereas ELs and non-ELs in the static condition appeared to rely on textual information to obtain new ideas about the scientific phenomena from the visualization. Compared to the static group, students in the dynamic group also more successfully evaluated and consolidated a range of ideas to develop coherent scientific explanations using evidence from the visualization. This study provides evidence that interactive dynamic visualizations have promise for supporting science learning for all students, including ELs who are often underserved in mainstream science classrooms. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A situational interest refers to the short-term spike in a person's attention and participation in an activity and it is triggered in the interactions between the person and environment features (e.g., novelty and surprise). As represented in the literature, extant conceptions of the phenomenon frame it fundamentally as a discontinuity in a person's experiences. Put differently, a situational interest denotes a moment in which a new object or activity is first brought into a person's stream of experiences and its triggering marks the boundary between two qualitatively distinct moments—a before-and-after—in one's ongoing activity participation. In contrast, I conjecture that situational interests are best understood as phenomena that combine both discontinuous and continuous dimensions of experience. To argue this point, I use three in-depth videotaped case studies of the triggering and (when available) retriggering of situational interests in STEM-based practices and show that the continuity + discontinuity lens provides a fine-grained and more accountable description of the phenomenon, its triggering process, and its eventual uptake and development (or not). © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Our study objectives were (1) to create the basis for a systems thinking language common to both science education and engineering education, and (2) to apply this language to assess science and engineering teachers’ systems thinking. We administered two assignments to teacher teams: first, modelling the same adapted scientific text, and second, modelling a synthesis of peer-reviewed articles in science and engineering education, with teams selecting a topic from a list and summarising them. We assessed those models using a rubric for systems thinking we had developed based on our literature review of this topic. We found high interrater reliability and validated the rubric’s theoretical construct for the system aspects of function, structure and behaviour. We found differences in scores between the assignments in favour of the second assignment, for two attributes of systems thinking: ‘expected outcome/intended purpose’ and ‘main object and its sub-objects’. We explain the first attribute difference as stemming from the modellers’ domain expertise as science or engineering teachers, rather than as scientists or engineers, and the second attribute difference–from the larger amount of information available for modelling the articles synthesis assignment. The theoretical contribution of this study lies in the definition of the systems thinking construct as a first step in establishing a common language for the science education and engineering education communities. The study's methodological contribution lies in the rubric we developed and validated, which can be used for assessing the systems thinking of teachers and potentially also of undergraduate students. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

In our experiences as educational researchers deeply engaged in partnerships with teachers, administrators, district, and state science curriculum supervisors, as well as in public-facing conversations about standards aligned with the Framework, we have repeatedly found ourselves in conversations about how the new reforms are similar or different to scientific inquiry, as well as other previous waves of reform.

Despite policy changes to redress these historical imbalances, Black African learners continue to underperform in science. Previous research has identified motivation as a key factor that impacts performance. Achievement goal orientation is a construct of motivation that explains learning behaviour. In an attempt to address the problem of learner motivation, this study investigated the effect of inquiry-based learning on the achievement goal-orientation of grade 10 physical sciences learners at historically disadvantaged township schools in South Africa. In South Africa, the term “township” usually refers to under-developed urban areas that were historically created for “non-whites” during the apartheid era. The findings showed that the experiment group of learners who experienced inquiry-based learning significantly gained in mastery goal orientation, while the control that were taught through a traditional direct didactic approach had an insignificant change in their mastery goal orientation. From these results, it can be concluded that inquiry-based learning does support a mastery goal orientation in learners. This orientation is regarded as desirable because mastery approach goals could support positive outcomes in conceptual learning, leading to an improvement in science achievement of learners. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Students represent their ideas in the form of notes, add their ideas to a collective knowledge base, and use this knowledge base as a resource for their subsequent inquiries. CK supports teachers’ orchestration of inquiry in blended learning environments, scaffolding the learning community as it progresses through a complex inquiry script. A community knowledge base is dynamically visualized on the classroom’s interactive whiteboard, serving as a persistent visual reference that allows teachers to gauge the progress of the class, identify patterns, gaps or conflicts, and engage the students in extemporaneous or planned discussions of their ideas. We present enactments of two design iterations in which CK was integrated within broader elementary science units where the curriculum was guided by a theoretical framework called Knowledge Community and Inquiry (KCI). For each version, we analyzed the role of CK in scaffolding student inquiry, with a focus on teachers’ facilitation of productive whole-class discussions. Analysis of teachers’ orchestration patterns revealed a “3R” orchestration cycle (Reflect–Refocus–Release) that teachers used repeatedly within a single class session, to guide reflective community discussion and refocus students’ inquiry. We also identified four distinct teacher discourse orientations, finding that these were invoked in different proportions depending on the orchestrational needs of the inquiry script.

Particularly challenging is the final step of the instructional change process, “refreezing,” when after making initial changes in instructional methods, instructors decide whether to continue with new instructional methods or return to their previous methods. Though this stage is important, it is not well studied. Most available studies about ongoing support following professional development on teaching merely state that facilitators made an effort to offer support, or report how frequently participants engaged with online support mechanisms through counting postings on listservs or message boards. Such measures do not show evidence that participants actually received positive reinforcement or intellectual and emotional support, which are crucial to refreezing, nor do these frequency analyses help other professional developers learn how to create productive ongoing support mechanisms that yield high participant engagement. Results: This workshop for 35 college mathematics instructors used online and in-person communities to provide support to participants during the post-workshop period of “refreezing.” Almost all workshop attendees participated in “e-mentoring” (94%), primarily through a productive, engaging group email listserv. By combining qualitative coding of message content with the techniques of social network analysis, we reveal how facilitators and participants on the group listserv provided intellectual and emotional support, as well as positive reinforcement through feedback loops. The analysis also shows how the facilitators made this a helpful group and maintained participant engagement through frequent encouragement, deliberate community building, and thoughtfully timed responses. Conclusions: Though many professional development workshops offer online support through email listservs, there is little evidence that these listservs successfully engage and support participants. Applying the analytic approach of social network analysis allowed us to model the conversation threads in one highly engaged and supportive listserv following a mathematics professional development workshop. This method revealed the processes of ongoing support in ways that traditional frequency-based analyses cannot. This method also revealed lessons for how other professional developers can create productive, helpful online support listservs. Since this is an innovative application of social network analysis, we describe the method in detail. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

The goal was to better understand the opportunities for explicit metamodeling talk in the science classroom. The findings revealed the ways in which they used language to frame the modelling work of the classroom. Instances of modelling talk were identified in classroom videos, and coded using a framework for metamodeling knowledge. Findings revealed that, while instances of metamodeling talk were common, they were largely implicit. This shows that the teachers were aware and knowledgeable about metamodeling ideas (e.g. the nature of models, process of modelling, etc.), but often did not make these ideas explicit to their students. Such findings suggest a trend of focusing on models of phenomena rather than supporting student engagement in the epistemic practice of modelling for reasoning about phenomena. The findings also revealed specific opportunities for explicit metamodeling talk by the teachers including during share-out sessions and the negotiation of explanation criteria.

The study’s theoretical framework brings together research from digital photography, participation in environmental science practices, and epistemic agency. Data analysed include field notes and video transcripts from two groups of learners (n = 19) that focus on how high school students used digital photography during their participation in two distinct environmental monitoring practices: stream mapping and macroinvertebrate identification. Our study resulted in two findings related to the role of digital photography where students developed knowledge as they engaged in environmental monitoring inquiry practices. First, we found that digital photography was integral to the youths’ epistemic agency (defined as their confidence that they could build knowledge related to science in their community) as they engaged in data collection, documenting environmental monitoring procedures, and sharing data in the classroom. Based this finding, an implication of our work is a refined view of the role of digital photography in environmental sciences education where the use of photography enhances epistemic agency in inquiry-based activities. Second, we found that the youths innovated a use of digital photography to foster a recognition that they were capable and competent in scientific procedures during a streamside study. Based on this finding, we offer a theoretical implication that expands the construct of epistemic agency; we posit that epistemic agency includes a subcomponent where the students purposefully formulate an external recognition as producers of scientific knowledge. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

However, there is limited prior research investigating how to facilitate such integrated STEM learning in formal classrooms that go beyond a simple combination of the different subject areas and instead enable teaching and learning of disciplinary concepts infused with scientific inquiry, engineering design, mathematical reasoning, and 21st century technological skills. In this paper, we investigate the affordances of using an educational Computer Aided Design tool, Energy 3D, and corresponding curricular materials to support such integrated STEM learning anchored in the engineering design process. We present an exploratory case study that was conducted in a middle school in the US, where a project-based learning approach was followed and students were asked to design a low-cost energy-efficient home within a given budget using the Energy3D CAD tool. Findings indicate that students learned to engage in the design process and demonstrated practices of idea fluency and systematic experimentation; practices usually representative of informed designers. During the design process while analyzing the problem space, generating ideas, and evaluating solutions, they developed better understanding of the relationships between variables and underlying science concepts, used various mathematical analysis tools and graphical representations embedded in the available technology to inform their engineering design decisions. The learning environment using Energy3D afforded formative feedback to help students understand relationship between variables, provided converging evidences using multiple analytical tools, and enabled visual problem decomposition using suboptimal model to engage students in integrated STEM learning.

As such, engaging with the materiality of that world is integral to both empirical experimentation and theorising within science. However, it has been recognised for some time that the way scientists learn about the world and the way that young people learn about science cannot be simply equated. This difference has been pronounced in recent decades by the dominance of constructivist and social-constructivist theories of learning, which focus on the development of concepts in the minds of people. Whilst these theories have yielded insight into the complexity of learning, the role of the material remains undertheorised, not only within practical science inquiry, but also in relation to the broader materiality of classrooms. Through a detailed critical literature review, this paper demonstrates the need for a stronger theoretical frame through which to understand the role of the material in the learning and pedagogy of science. Building upon the gaps and possibilities that this review reveals, we outline a new material-dialogic theory via a synthesis of Barad’s Agential Realism and Bakhtinian dialogic theory. The significance of this paper lies in offering a theoretical basis for more effective practice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Thus, the teacher's role in providing motivational support is crucial. This research examines how the interplay among the inquiry's characteristics, the challenges encountered by students, and the motivational support provided by the teacher affects students' expression of motivation throughout an online inquiry process. The messages of both the teacher and the students were examined using self-determination theory (SDT). The results indicate that the students did not automatically embrace the autonomous characteristic of open inquiry. Their expressions of motivation were dynamic, affected by the challenges that they encountered. In contrast, the teacher maintained high levels of autonomy and competence and intertwined these components in a strategy that we term guided autonomy. The teacher and students expressed high-order expressions of affect. In addition, we found a positive correlation between the teacher's motivational support and the students' expressions of motivation.

All of these teachers were in their second or third year teaching which was 3–4 years after taking the methods course. Investigation methods included questionnaires, field observations and semi-structured, individual interviews. Teachers more regularly utilised reform-based teaching strategies and cited the after school teaching practicum as preparing them to use these strategies in their own classrooms. All teachers exhibited a growth mindset to some degree, but the after school practicum participants did demonstrate a wider use of reformed-based teaching strategies and a higher growth mindset.

This study attempts to investigate if learner-generated materials could promote active and inquiry-based learning in such a class and help develop positive attitudes towards flipped learning in general. It also seeks to understand the role, perceived value and ease of using authoring tools used to build learning materials in facilitating inquiry-based active learning in the classroom. It adopts a sequential explanatory mixed-methods research design, in which 40 intermediate Turkish learners of English studied various topics in phonetics and phonology by creating learning materials in teams. The analysis of the data from a post-instruction survey and follow-up interviews with 8 participants imply that learner-generated materials produced using user-friendly authoring tools seem to be a good option for learners to get involved in research in a flipped class. The findings also revealed that although the learners reported mostly positive attitudes and that the higher and lower scorers (Moodle Scores) viewed the flipped learning model almost equally valuable, the higher scorers talked more positively about how the course was delivered. However, as the findings indicated, radical changes introduced by both the use of the flipped model itself and new software and a lesson sequence based on thinking, production and research might constitute a major challenge for students that are accustomed to traditional methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

This study investigated how two forms of scaffolding embedded in dynamic visualizations, expert guidance and generating guidance, can foster ELLs' and non-ELLs' understanding of unobservable scientific phenomena. While interacting with dynamic visualizations, students in the expert guidance condition were provided with scientifically accurate explanations to interpret visual representations, whereas students in the generating guidance condition were prompted to generate their own explanations using visual representations. The results show the significant advantage of generating guidance over expert guidance for both ELLs and non-ELLs, although students in the generating guidance condition did not receive feedback on their generated artifacts. Analyses of video data and log data from 40 pairs revealed that each form of scaffolding affected the quantity and quality of linguistically diverse students' conversations. The results show that generating guidance enabled students, particularly ELLs, to engage in discourse-rich practices to evaluate various sources of evidence from the visualization and compare the evidence to their alternative ideas to develop a coherent understanding of the target concepts.

So far, however, relatively little is known about how this impacts teachers’ educational beliefs, even though these beliefs ultimately determine their classroom behavior. The present study therefore investigates how immersion in inquiry-based learning affects student teachers’ beliefs about knowledge goals, in addition to their self-efficacy for inquiry. In total, 302 student history teachers participated in a 4-h long inquiry activity designed within the WISE learning environment, and completed a pre- and posttest right before and after the intervention. Multilevel analyses suggest that the intervention had a significant positive effect on the value that student teachers attributed to procedural knowledge goals, or learning how historical knowledge is constructed, and on student teachers’ self-efficacy for conducting inquiries. Despite these general positive results, however, the results also show that the impact of the intervention differed significantly across students. In particular, it appears that immersion in IBL had little effect on a subgroup of 25 student-teachers, who held largely content-oriented beliefs. Based on these findings, the present study discusses a number of implications for professional development on IBL. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Article","Scopus"

Inquiry strengthens the positive approach of pupils to natural science subjects, encouraging them to study phenomena and processes taking place in the natural environment around them and use the acquired knowledge in their practical life. Geography as a school subject, due to the multidisciplinary nature of geography as a science, is close to natural sciences as well. This is because of the broadness of the subject of geographical studies, the complex (natural and cultural) landscape. The close links of geography to all cross-sectional themes make it a good support for teaching classical science subjects at schools such as mathematics, physics, chemistry or biology, environmental education. Moreover, the field teaching is one of the strong assets of the implementation of IBE in the school geography. Presented case study on the ‘effect of noise on the surroundings’ explores the facts mentioned above, in geography teaching. It verifies the pupils’ knowledge and skills to adopt the basic principles of IBE in the practice. At the same time, it presents the concrete experiences how the children master the individual stages of IBE during the process of education. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

While many policy documents call for students to learn more about the structure of the engineering discipline, little has been done to define the NOE construct. This paper presents key dimensions of the NOE via a framework synthesized from studies of the engineering discipline from philosophical, historical, and sociological perspectives, as well as perspectives from within the engineering field. The framework identifies and elaborates nine features of engineering, each of which capture an important aspect of the NOE. For teachers, these features serve as points of entry for discussing NOE ideas with students.

However, scattered in the literature are extrinsic and intrinsic teaching challenges linked to the design and implementation of inquiry-based practical work (IBPW) in secondary school science classrooms. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to characterize and clarify the intrinsic challenges. From an instructional design perspective, the characterization of the challenges yielded four primary categories. The categories consist of initiation-phase challenges (such as unfavorable views regarding science and practical work), planning-phase challenges (including difficulties involved in designing IBPW), implementation-phase challenges (e.g., persuading learners to reflect on their experiences and findings), and summative evaluation-phase challenges which include concerns linked to the grading of practical inquiry. In the different categories, the challenges are linked to gaps in various aspects of teacher competencies especially in the context of the TPACK framework. The aspects include content knowledge (CK) (such as science content and scientific inquiry); in addition to technological knowledge (TK) linked to standard technologies. Also included is pedagogic CK (including orientation toward science teaching). Moreover, some of the intrinsic challenges are linked to gaps in skills (including pervasive classroom management and practical skills); in addition to values (such as commitment). These results have theory-, practice-, and research-based implications. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Review","Scopus"

The narrative inquiry research method is used to elucidate the students’ academic trajectories. Incidents of circumstantial and planned parent curriculum making surfaced when the data was serially interpreted. Other themes included: (1) relationships between (student) learners and (teacher) parents, (2) invitations to inquiry, (3) modes of inquiry, (4) the improbability of certainty, and (5) changed narratives = changed lives. While policy briefs provide sweeping statements about parents’ positive effects on their children, narrative inquiries such as this one illuminate parents’ inquiry moves within home environments. These actions became retrospectively revealed in their adult children’s lived narratives.

This study builds on prior research to characterise teacher interactions with small groups in secondary science and analyses how those interactions affect a collectively constructed space–the triple problem solving space (TPSS)–in which group members collectively understand a task (content/cognitive dimension), manage social interactions (social/relational dimension), and co-construct the emotional life of the group (affective dimension). Results of two biology teachers’ interactions with students in small groups working on inquiry and engineering design activities show that most interactions were administrative and had little influence on the group’s TPSS. Teacher interactions that engaged students in monitoring their problem-solving process, however, did have the capacity to increase cognitive work of the group, which subsequently impacted the students’ group affect and social dimension. These findings suggest that interactions focused on cognitive processes have the potential to support all aspects of a group’s TPSS.

In this study, a meta review of the studies published in academic journals from 1971 to 2016 was conducted to analyze the application domains, subjects, adopted learning strategies, investigated research issues and findings of mobile technology-supported nursing education. From the review results, it was found that the use of mobile technologies in nursing education and training have made great progress in the past decades. In addition to the changes in mobile technologies and the increasing number of mobile learning studies in nursing education, the subjects and research issues have also become more diverse in recent years. It was also found that mobile learning has mainly been applied to the training of basic nursing concepts and skills as well as to long-term care and obstetrics and gynecology, while few or even no studies are related to other nursing education domains. In addition, several widely adopted mobile learning strategies, such as inquiry-based learning, contextual mobile learning, snychronous sharing, Mindtools, project-based learning and peer assessment, have seldom been adopted in mobile nursing education. This also reflects the fact that most of these studies focused on skills training and basic knowledge comprehension, while few were conducted in the domains aimed at fostering learners' higher order thinking competences, such as problem solving or critical thinking. On the other hand, it was found that the number of studies using an experimental design has increased in recent years; moreover, most studies reported the learners’ cognitive performance and perceptions, while their learning behaviors were seldom analyzed. Accordingly, the research trends and potential research issues of mobile nursing education are proposed as a reference for researchers, instructors and policy makers. © 2017","Article","Scopus"

However, the construct of evidence remains largely underspecified in these documents, providing insufficient guidance on how to engage students with the broad and complex nature of evidentiary reasoning. This creates a risk of perfunctory and simplified implementation of evidence-based practices that misses the intent of the standards and does little to prepare students for reasoning with the complex, varied, and contentious evidence encountered in popular media or in advanced education. To address these challenges, we propose a theoretical framework, which we call Grasp of Evidence, that complexifies the concept of evidence in ways that facilitate introducing more authentic forms of evidence and more sophisticated ways of engaging with evidence in science classrooms. Our approach focuses on promoting a lay grasp of evidence needed by competent outsiders as they engage with science in their everyday lives. The framework posits five dimensions. The first four dimensions capture what students should understand about how experts work with evidence: evidence analysis, evidence evaluation, evidence interpretation, and evidence integration. The fifth dimension focuses on how laypeople can use evidence reports themselves. Each of these dimensions of practice involves specific epistemic aims, epistemic ideals, and reliable epistemic processes for reasoning with and about evidence. We discuss these dimensions and their contribution to the conceptualization of evidence as well as provide some initial instructional implications and potential directions for future research. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

This article considers whether valid and reliable evidence can be obtained in online performance tasks to yield an estimate of both student inquiry practices and of the ability of students to explain their understanding of scientific concepts. A data set from a Virtual Performance Assessment (VPA) task, There's a New Frog in Town, is examined. Delivered through an online system, the VPA task engages students in guided inquiry through problem solving, modeling, and exploration. The VPAs are designed to produce evidence on more than one latent trait in the respondent performance. Results of the case study reported here indicated that maps of student proficiency in scientific inquiry were possible to generate from the VPA data set, using measurement models. Addition of process data through a new hybrid measurement model, mIRT-Bayes, improved reliability of results. Results indicated overall that virtual performance tasks may be helpful for science assessment, especially if assessment time is short and a goal is to increase the validity and quality of performance measures with authentic and engaging virtual activities. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The findings confirmed the reliability and validity of the CoI survey instrument for the assessment of the key dimensions of the CoI model: teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence. Although the CoI survey instrument captured the same latent constructs within the MOOC context as in the Garrison's three-factor model (Garrison et al., 1999), analyses suggested a six-factor model with additional three factors as a better fit to the data. These additional factors were 1) course organization and design (a sub-component of teaching presence), 2) group affectivity (a sub-component of social presence), and 3) resolution phase of inquiry learning (a sub-component of cognitive presence). The emergence of these additional factors revealed that the discrepancies between the dynamics of the traditional online courses and MOOCs affect the student perceptions of the three CoI presences.

We compare the use of these two tools in large enrollment STEM courses delivered in different contexts, one in biology and one in engineering. Typically, the research literature contains studies that compare student performance for a group where the given active learning tool is used to a control group where it is not used. While such studies are valuable, they do not necessarily provide thick descriptions that allow instructors to understand how to effectively use the tool in their instructional practice. Investigations on the intended student thinking processes using these tools are largely missing. In the present article, we fill this gap by foregrounding the intended student thinking and sense-making processes of such active learning tools by comparing their enactment in two large-enrollment courses in different contexts. Results: The instructors studied utilized each of the active learning tools differently. In the biology course, ARS questions were used mainly to “check in” with students and assess if they were correctly interpreting and understanding worksheet questions. The engineering course presented ARS questions that afforded students the opportunity to apply learned concepts to new scenarios towards improving students’ conceptual understanding. In the biology course, the GIWs were primarily used in stand-alone activities, and most of the information necessary for students to answer the questions was contained within the worksheet in a context that aligned with a disciplinary model. In the engineering course, the instructor intended for students to reference their lecture notes and rely on their conceptual knowledge of fundamental principles from the previous ARS class session in order to successfully answer the GIW questions. However, while their specific implementation structures and practices differed, both instructors used these tools to build towards the same basic disciplinary thinking and sense-making processes of conceptual reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and metacognitive thinking. Conclusions: This study led to four specific recommendations for post-secondary instructors seeking to integrate active learning tools into STEM courses. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

Drawing on theory of network, this research focuses on bestfriendships that may contribute to positive school experience or school belonging in the context of school-wide interactions. We emphasize that school-wide unity is essential to refer to shared perceived friendship experience at the school level. The basic trust of this study is that managers should consider interconnectedness as a complex system of entangled interactions among students. We investigate best friendship network on the meso-to-macro scale. Particular attention is paid to the network phenomena of the largest component and network correlations for examining school-wide unity. The results show that abundance of asymmetric friendships leads to unity around school wide interactions. As suggested by network theory, popular students’ tendency to avoid forming closed clusters assures sustainability in school-wide friendships, and having same gender type or being classmates correlate highly with the choice of best friends, in contrast to achievement scores. Metadata correlations reveal same-gender and same-class clubs. Incorporating meso level findings into macro level indicates that some metadata (e.g. gender) may be considered as salient characteristics of the communities while other metadata (e.g. achievement scores) may be irrelevant. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

In this mixed methods study, student learning in two different laboratory settings was compared, one that featured an instruction that engaged students in a wide range of disciplinary practices (through Argument-driven Inquiry–ADI) and similar laboratories in which a more traditional Structured Inquiry (SI) approach was employed. The data sources included a Chemistry Concept test, an Argumentative Writing Assessment, and Semi-structured interviews. After seven weeks of chemistry instruction, students experiencing ADI instruction scored higher on the Chemistry Concept test and the Argumentative Writing Assessment than students experiencing SI instruction. Furthermore, girls who experienced ADI instruction scored higher on the assessments than their majority peers in the same class. The results suggest that Turkish students can substantially improve their chemistry proficiency if they have an opportunity to engage in instruction featuring a broad array of the practices of science. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

This is partially due to the lack of any assessment instrument to measure understandings about scientific inquiry. However, a valid and reliable assessment has recently been developed and published, Views About Scientific Inquiry (VASI; Lederman et al. [2014], Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 51, 65–83). The purpose of this large-scale international project was to collect the first baseline data on what beginning middle school students have learned about scientific inquiry during their elementary school years. Eighteen countries/regions spanning six continents including 2,634 students participated in the study. The participating countries/regions were: Australia, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, England, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Mainland China, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States. In many countries, science is not formally taught until middle school, which is the rationale for choosing seventh grade students for this investigation. This baseline data will simultaneously provide information on what, if anything, students learn about inquiry in elementary school, as well as their beginning knowledge as they enter secondary school. It is important to note that collecting data from all of the approximately 200 countries globally was not humanly possible, and it was also not possible to collect data from every region of each country. The results overwhelmingly show that students around the world at the beginning of grade seven have very little understandings about scientific inquiry. Some countries do show reasonable understandings in certain aspects but the overall picture of understandings of scientific inquiry is not what is hoped for after completing 6 years of elementary education in any country. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

This study proposes and investigates the effects of a three-dimensional thinking graph (3DTG) that allows learners to combine in a single image, problem information, subject knowledge (key concepts and their relationships), and the hypothesizing and reasoning process involved in exploring a problem, to support inquiry learning. Two classes of eleventh grade students (97 in total) were randomly assigned to use either the 3DTG (i.e., experimental condition) or concept map (i.e., control condition) to complete a group-based inquiry task in an online environment. Data were collected from multiple data sources, including measures of group inquiry task performance, postknowledge scores, postquestionnaires of student perceptions of consensus building, and open-ended survey. The analysis of group task performance revealed that participants in the experimental condition performed better in the inquiry task than their counterparts specifically in generating hypotheses and reasoning with data, but not in drawing conclusions. The findings show the 3DTG's benefits in facilitating exploring and justifying hypotheses, and also suggest that the 3DTG can share equal value with concept mapping in terms of drawing conclusions and consensus building. In addition, students using the 3DTG achieved higher scores in the postknowledge test, although no difference was found in their perceptions of consensus building. These findings were validated by students' responses to the survey. Implications of this study and future work are also discussed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

In classrooms, however, the position of not-understanding is generally a liability; confusion is an unfortunate condition to resolve as quickly as possible, or to conceal. In this article, we argue that students' public displays of uncertainty or confusion can be pivotal contributions to the classroom dynamics in initiating and sustaining a class's science inquiry. We present this as a central finding from a cross-case analysis of eight episodes of students' scientific engagement, drawing on literature on framing to show how participants positioned themselves as not-understanding and how that was consequential for the class's scientific engagement. We show how participants enacted this positioning by asking questions or expressing uncertainty around a phenomenon or model. We then analyze how participants' displays of not-understanding shaped the conceptual, epistemic, and social aspects of classroom activity. We present two cases in detail: one in which a student's positioning helped initiate the class's scientific engagement and another in which it helped sustain it. We argue that this work motivates considering how to help students learn to embrace and value the role of expressing one's confusion in science. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Students, however, often design experiments that do not allow them to reach conclusions. Considering the difficulties students experience with the process of designing experiments, additional guidance in the form of an Experiment Design Tool (EDT) was developed, together with reflection questions. In this study, 147 pre-university students worked in an online inquiry learning environment on buoyancy and Archimedes’ principle. Students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions, each of which contained a different version of the EDT. Since students’ prior knowledge has been found to influence the amount and type of guidance they need, the versions of the tool differed with respect to the level of guidance provided. A pre- and post-test were administered to assess students’ conceptual knowledge. No overall differences between conditions were found. In a subsequent analysis, students were classified as either low, low-intermediate-, high-intermediate, or high prior knowledge students. For Archimedes’ principle we found that low-intermediate prior knowledge students gained significantly more conceptual knowledge than low prior knowledge students in the fully guided condition. It is hypothesised that students need at least some prior knowledge in order to fully benefit from the guidance offered. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

A cognitive view of objectivity informs existing research, neglecting the localized production of objectivity during classroom practices and associated emotional experiences. To inform understandings about objectivity, we adopt an ethnomethodological orientation for understanding students' situated practices during science inquiry tasks. Transcripts produced from video recordings of group interactions are collected into salient episodes using ethnomethodological conventions. We extend beyond the fine-grained ethnomethodological description to analyze transcript data by drawing on a theoretical perspective from the microsociology of emotion. Outcomes include an understanding of how objectivity came to exist through the dialectic relationship between objectivity and subjectivity that are linked via emotional experience.

The study compared students' learning outcomes in the hands-on inquiry condition that incorporated the two instructional elements, with learning in the explicit investigation condition that only involved learners in manipulations, and in direct instruction condition that excluded the two instructional elements. The results showed that the instructional conditions affected students' learning of energy transfer in knowing and reasoning, but not in applying.

However, many factors influence the actual outcomes and effect on students’ learning when using inquiry materials. In this study, discourse from two physical chemistry classrooms using the Process-Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) approach was analyzed using a lens of scientific argumentation. Analysis of the complexity of reasoning in students’ arguments using a learning progression on chemical thinking indicated that students did not employ very complex reasoning to construct arguments. To explain the distribution of reasoning observed, a separate analysis of the curricular materials was performed using the Task Analysis Guide for Science (TAGS). Results indicate a relationship between the task's targeted scientific practice and how students used evidence in their arguments as well as between the task's cognitive demand and the complexity of reasoning employed in arguments. Examples illustrating these relationships can be used to inform implications for design of inquiry materials, facilitation of classroom discourse, and future research. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, few programmes focus specifically on the teaching competencies required by GTAs who work with undergraduate students in laboratory settings where learning tends to be more active and inquiry based than in classroom settings. From a review of 8 GTA manuals, we identified 20 competencies and then surveyed faculty and lab coordinators (FIS) and GTAs from a Faculty of Science at a comprehensive Canadian university to identify which of those competencies are required of GTAs who work in undergraduate science labs. GTAs and FIS did not significantly differ in the competencies they view as required for GTAs to work effectively in undergraduate labs. But, when comparing the responses of GTAs and FIS to TA manuals, ‘Clearly and effectively communicates ideas and information with students’ was the only competency for which there was agreement on the level of requirement. We also examined GTAs’ self-efficacy for each of the identified competencies and found no overall relationship between self-efficacy and demographic characteristics, including experience and training. Our results can be used to inform the design of training programmes specifically for GTAs who work in undergraduate science labs, for example, programmes should provide strategies for GTAs to obtain feedback which they can use to enhance their teaching skills. The goal of this study is to improve undergraduate lab instruction in faculties of science and to enhance the teaching experience of GTAs by better preparing them for their role. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

School Sci Math 114: 291–301, 2014) and increase the chances a student will pursue a STEM career (Kitchen et al. Sci Educ 102: 529–547, 2018). The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of an informal STEM summer learning experience on student participants, to gain in-depth perspectives about how they felt this experience prepared them for their in-school mathematics and science classes as well as how it influenced their perception of STEM learning. Students’ attitudes and perceptions toward STEM are affected by their motivation, experience, and self-efficacy (Brown et al. J STEM Educ Innov Res 17: 27, 2016). The academic and social experiences students’ have are also important. Traditionally, formal learning is taught in a solitary form (Martin Science Education 88: S71–S82, 2004), while, informal learning is brimming with chances to connect and intermingle with peers (Denson et al. J STEM Educ: Innovations and Research 16: 11, 2015). Results: We used a naturalistic inquiry, phenomenological approach to examine students’ perceptions of STEM while participating in a summer informal learning experience. Data came from students at the summer informal STEM learning experiences at three diverse institutions across the USA. Data were collected from reflection forms and interviews which were designed to explore students’ “lived experiences” (Van Manen 1990, p. 9) and how those experiences influenced their STEM learning. As we used a situative lens to examine the research question of how participation in an informal learning environment influences students’ perceptions of STEM learning, three prominent themes emerged from the data. The informal learning environment (a) provided context and purpose to formal learning, (b) provided students opportunity and access, and (c) extended STEM content learning and student engagement. Conclusions: By using authentic STEM workplaces, the STEM summer learning experience fostered a learning environment that extended and deepened STEM content learning while providing opportunity and access to content, settings, and materials that most middle level students otherwise would not have access to. Students also acknowledged the access they received to hands-on activities in authentic STEM settings and the opportunities they received to interact with STEM professionals were important components of the summer informal learning experience. © 2018, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

To understand this complex context affected by various factors in schools, we investigated the formation and sharing process of science classroom norms in connection with these factors. By examining the developmental process of science classroom norms, we identified how the norms were realized, shared, and internalized among the members. We collected data through classroom observations and interviews focusing on two elementary science classrooms in Korea. From these data, factors influencing norm formation were extracted and developed as stories about norm establishment. The results indicate that every science classroom norm was established, shared, and internalized differently according to the values ingrained in the norms, the agent of norm formation, and the members’ understanding about the norm itself. The desirable norms originating from values in science education, such as having an inquiring mind, were not established spontaneously by students, but were instead established through well-organized norm networks to encourage concrete practice. Educational implications were discussed in terms of the practice of school science inquiry, cultural studies, and value-oriented education. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

For primary school teachers, the open nature of IBSE poses challenges as they often lack experience in supporting their pupils during the different phases of an open IBSE project, such as formulating a research question and designing and conducting an investigation. The current study aims to meet these challenges by presenting a pedagogical framework in which four domains of scientific knowledge are addressed in seven phases of inquiry. The framework is based on video analyses of pedagogical interventions by primary school teachers participating in open IBSE projects. Our results show that teachers can guide their pupils successfully through the process of open inquiry by explicitly addressing the conceptual, epistemic, social and/or procedural domain of scientific knowledge in the subsequent phases of inquiry. The paper concludes by suggesting further research to validate our framework and to develop a pedagogy for primary school teachers to guide their pupils through the different phases of open inquiry. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

We designed resources that frame scientific sensemaking as an active and playful process of exploration in which family members are coparticipants. This approach contrasts with more traditional school-like canonical patterns of engagement in family science conversations where adults state facts and provide explanations to children. The Anytime, Anywhere resources were designed to locate phenomena of interest in outdoor settings and cue families about how they might engage playfully in exploration by using sensemaking activities and conversation starters. We analyzed families’ video-recorded activities and interviews as they field-tested the resources at a coastal beach. The analysis shows families engaged in three features of scientific sensemaking, both in response to our designed activities and spontaneously. They elicited ideas and mechanistic processes, made hypotheses, and experimented to test ideas. We propose emerging design recommendations for Anytime, Anywhere family scientific sensemaking activities, which can inform learning design in a variety of settings. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

This paper presents a case study of students learning in a unique apprenticeship model in which students are engaged in long-term (18 month) open-ended research projects in physics that are done at the laboratory in school, and in which the project advisor is a physics teacher supported by a community of teacher–researchers. The goals of the study were to characterize what the students learned, how they perceived their inquiry and their role in it, the features of mentorship they received and the social-infrastructure in which they and their advisor functioned. Qualitative data were collected over a whole school year through interviews, weekly observations, and content analysis of the final research reports. Participants were the focus advisor, and some of his former and current project mentees. Data on the larger educational context were collected from other project advisors and their mentees. The study documented students’ learning gains such as learning of scientific content and skills, internalization of scientific habits of thought as well as developing passion, interest, and agency with regard to science. It documented features of students’ engagement that reflect deep involvement in the technical and epistemic aspects of the inquiry, and highlighted the specific features of mentorship, and the social infrastructure that fostered this learning and engagement. It concluded with a theoretical examination of the interaction between a cultural discipline (i.e., physics), the social infrastructure in which the advisor and the students function, the advisor's mentorship style, and the students’ learning and engagement.

The goal of instruction was to help students learn to use simple particle models to explain states of matter and phase changes. We examined changes in students’ ideas about matter, the coherence of their emerging particle models, and how classroom science discourse influenced students’ learning. The study was conducted in two second grade classrooms in a rural Midwestern public school. We worked with the two teachers to help them design modeling activities for students to complement lessons from the Full Option Science System (FOSS™) science curriculum the teachers had previously used. Our data sources for student learning included individual interviews with students before and after they completed the set of Modeling in the Primary Grades (MPG) lessons, artifacts created by students during learning such as posters and science notebook entries, and videotapes of MPG lessons. Our findings suggest that second grade students who engaged in MPG model-based inquiry lessons learned to use simple particle models to describe and explain a variety of material phenomena. For example, they could use particle models to account for differences in the appearance and behavior of solids, liquids, and gases and to explain what happens to matter during phase transitions. We also found variations in how MPG teachers structured classroom discourse, and our results suggest that such variations are associated with differences in the coherence of student models. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The context of the study was early-years education. The study has two parts: The first part involved classes attended by pre-primary children aged 4-6. The second part included one primary class attended by students aged 6-8 in addition to the pre-primary classes. Students were involved in inquiry-based science activities. Two sources of data were used: Lesson recordings and children’s assessments. The data from both sources were separately analyzed and the findings plotted. The resulting graphs indicate a linear relationship between the overall performance of the younger children in a class and the number of older ones participating in the groups in each class. It seems that the age composition of the groups can significantly affect the overall cognitive achievements of the younger children and preferentially determines the time within which this factor reaches its maximum value.

Teachers in the induction phase benefit from professional development experiences that support them as they continue to learn about teaching by analyzing their own teaching experiences. The context of this qualitative study is the implementation of video recorded classroom observations within an established distance mentoring program, e-Mentoring for Student Success (eMSS; Jaffe et al. [2006] Online professional development for teachers, Cambridge, MA: Harvard Education Press). These observations were designed to include a cycle of three activities: a pre-observation discussion in which the mentor-mentee pair set a focus for the observation, the sharing of a video recording of a short classroom episode, and a post-observation discussion in which mentor and mentee analyzed evidence from the video in light of the observation focus and determined an action plan of next steps for the new teacher to implement. Studying the dynamic interactions between mentors and mentees as they inquired into specific aspects of teaching and analyzed evidence from the classroom episode helped to identify the conditions that supported such collaboration and the impacts it had on mentees' professional growth. Findings from this study indicate that observation cycles conducted with a disciplined inquiry stance help mentors and mentees to focus on concrete evidence, analyze a hypothesis about the impacts of teacher actions on student learning, and collaboratively evaluate instruction and determine instructional next steps. For science teacher educators who work with teachers in their induction years, this study suggests that observation cycles are an important activity to support teachers as they learn from the act of teaching, and can be incorporated into a mentoring program, whether it occurs at a distance or face-to-face. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Features such as distributed agency, large spatial scales, and time delays obscure co-variation relationships and complex interactions can result in non-deterministic relationships between causes and effects that are best understood statistically. Causal Bayesian Research (e.g. Gopnik and Schulz in Causal learning: psychology, philosophy, and computation, Oxford University Press, New York, 2007) suggests that summing across probabilistic instances is inherent to human causal induction, yet other research (e.g. Schulz and Sommerville in Child Development 77(2):427–442, 2006) suggests a human tendency to assume deterministic relationships. Classroom science learning often stresses the replicability of outcomes, putting this learning in tension with understanding probabilistic patterns in complex systems. This investigation examined students’ reasoning patterns on tasks with probabilistic causal features. Microgenetic studies were conducted in multiple sessions over a school year with students in kindergarten, second, fourth and sixth grades (n = 16) to assess their assumptions when dealing with tasks from four domains: social; games; machines; and biology. Later sessions attempted to scaffold students’ understanding using connection making and analogical reasoning. This paper reports on the overall patterns and trends in the data. Most students held a deterministic stance at the outset; however, at least one student at each grade level reasoned probabilistically from the start. All students except one eventually revealed at least one topic for which they held a primarily probabilistic stance. The results have implications for how students reason about complex systems and for how patterns of co-variation and evidence in science are discussed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Scopus"

Analyses revealed varying teaching strategies, differing with regard to direction (teacher directed, student directed and mixed) and different perspectives of regulation (meta-cognitive, conceptual, and social regulation). Results show that important teacher strategies in metacognitive regulation are: focussing on thinking skills, developing a culture of inquiry, supporting inquiry discourse, and promoting nature of science; in conceptual regulation: providing information on the research topic and focussing on conceptual understanding; and in social regulation: bridging the gap between high and low achievers, organizing student learning in groups and focussing on collaboration processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Scopus"

Inquiry-based science has emphasized engagement in activities that reflect authentic scientific practices. Constructionism has focused on designing intuitively accessible authoring environments and microworlds that embody the structure of a content domain in program code. Learners build, extend, or explore artifacts to make sense of underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we bridge these bodies of work to argue that interacting with program code of a computational model can facilitate engagement in inquiry-based science. Tinkering with code involves students playfully manipulating the code of a computational model to generate and pursue goals or questions in the model. We use data from video-recorded interviews with eleven 10th grade students in which they demonstrate their tinkering explorations with code of models of biological phenomena, and describe related interactions with other students. We analyze these data using a conceptual framework of inquiry-based science consisting of three components: pursuit of investigations, sense making of investigations, and engagement with a community. We characterize points of alignment between students’ tinkering and these components to argue that tinkering with code underlying computational models facilitated engagement in inquiry-based science. We also demonstrate how it provided opportunities for disciplinary engagement in two ways: Computational engagement or using code as a representational medium to pursue questions of interest, and conceptual engagement, or coming to notice and explain resulting changes in the modeled phenomenon. More broadly, we argue that the constructionist approach of interacting with and manipulating program code of computational models can facilitate productive forms of engagement with inquiry-based science. We discuss affordances of interacting with code as a way to engage in inquiry, and provide design recommendations for the adoption of manipulation of code as an inquiry practice. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This mixed methods inquiry employed 30 semi-structured interviews and an online survey (N = 679) to explore why and how undergraduates from across disciplines view SMTs to be a meaningful part of their university learning. Findings shed new insights into student perspectives on and uses of social media, and the variety of ways in which undergraduates intentionally choose (or, choose not) to incorporate social media into their university learning in meaningful ways. Student perceptions formed an overarching theme of social media as a double-edged sword that both informs and distracts, having the potential to both help and hinder learning. Together, the interviews and the open-ended survey results demonstrate that several contextual relationships exist, underscoring the importance of considering affordances of social media for learning. Rather than taking an approach founded upon technological determinism, learning context and social media affordances become key. Undergraduate perceptions of educational interactions via social media illustrate the prominence of student-student and student-content, rather than faculty-student, interactions via social media in their learning, allowing for an updated understanding of previous educational interactions models. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Scopus"

One focus in this context lies on teachers’ professional knowledge. We describe this knowledge according to three domains, namely (1) content knowledge (CK), (2) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and (3) curricular knowledge (CuK). We hypothesise a positive relationship between these three domains and students’ performance in science. Students’ science performance was conceptualised by system thinking performance in the context of biology teaching. In order to test our hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the knowledge triplet CK, PCK, and CuK and students’ performance. 48 biology teachers and their students (N = 1036) participated in this study. Teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ performance were measured by paper-and-pencil tests. Moreover, we used concept maps to further assess students’ performance. By specifying doubly latent models, we found a significant positive relationship between biology teachers’ PCK and students’ performance. On the contrary, the results reveal no relationship between CK and CuK and students’ performance. These findings are discussed in respect to modelling the interrelationship of teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ learning in science, as well as concerning their relevance for further research and teacher education programmes. © 2017 The Author(s).

Extensive empirical research about how some aspects of NOS can be effectively taught is also available. The most widely adopted conceptualization of NOS is based on a small number of general aspects of NOS, which fall into two groups: aspects of the nature of scientific knowledge (NOSK) and aspects of scientific inquiry (SI). This conceptualization of NOS will be described in this article as the ""general aspects"" conceptualization of NOS. Proponents of this conceptualization have concluded from empirical research that particular general aspects of NOS can be effectively taught at various K-12, undergraduate, and teacher preparation courses. Yet, this conceptualization has been criticized as being insufficient and even as misrepresenting science. Critics suggest that a more complete picture of science should be communicated to teachers and students, rather than a list of general aspects of NOS. In this article, I suggest that the ""general aspects"" conceptualization of NOS provides an effective starting point for teaching about NOS and for addressing students' preconceptions about science. Once this is done, teaching could include more complex aspects and attend simultaneously to multiple contexts, as the critics suggest. This might be achieved along a learning pathway, in which the ""general aspects"" conceptualization of NOS might nicely pave the way for the ""family resemblance"" conceptualization of NOS, espoused by several of the critics because of explicit continuities between them. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The results show that the very effective teachers spent significantly more time engaged in using embodied representations to illustrate points or communicate information. They also spent significantly more time engaged in interrogating students’ understandings and scaffolding and challenging their thinking than the effective teachers. In turn, the students in the very effective teachers’ classes spent significantly more time on-task and used significantly more relevant basic and scientific language to explain the phenomena they were investigating than their peers in the effective teachers’ classes.

We compared the ability of three self-report instruments (Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument Form A [STEBI], Teaching of Science as Inquiry instrument [TSI], Inquiry Teaching Beliefs instrument [ITB]) and one observational instrument (Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol [RTOP]) to appropriately measure high school chemistry teachers’ beliefs as they engaged in a two and a half year professional development program. Collectively our findings from these four instruments, across three separate cohort of teachers (N = 16), indicated conflicting changes in teacher beliefs.

Thus, studies are needed that examine how particular participants take up learning opportunities (LOs) in informal contexts. In this ethnographic case study, we focus on the learning experiences of one fifth-grade girl, Nina, who reported that she was not able to learn as much as she had hoped from her participation in an afterschool robotics engineering club. Through analysis of video-recordings, interviews, and field notes, we investigated how instructors and peers shaped LOs for Nina and the environmental tensions that affected how LOs were shaped and how Nina took them up. Comparison of examples in which instructor and peer-afforded LOs were realized and unrealized (i.e., presented in ways that Nina could take them up or not) illuminates multiple tensions. Club members faced tensions related to differing goals and abilities to teach each other, while the instructors faced tensions related to their roles in informal learning environments and their propensity to direct participants to other resources. As a result, many potential LOs for Nina in this rich inquiry learning environment where unrealized because instructors and peers did not shape them in ways that were explicit, elaborated upon, or connected to Nina’s prior knowledge, and because Nina was not necessarily attuned to potential LOs in the informal context. We conclude with implications for instructors in informal learning environments. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Scopus"

A complexity approach represents systems as many interacting entities. The construct of micro–macro compatibility is introduced, the degree of similarity between behaviors at the micro- and macro-levels of the system. Seventh-grade students’ learning about gases was studied using questionnaires and interviews. An experimental group (n = 47) learned with a complexity curriculum that included agent-based computer models, a workbook, class discussions, and laboratory experiments. A comparison group (n = 45) learned with a normative curriculum, incorporating lectures, a textbook, class discussions, and laboratory experiments. Significant learning gains and strong effect sizes were found in the experimental group's overall learning. Diffusion, density, and kinetic molecular theory were learned better with a complexity approach. Pressure, temperature, and the gas laws were learned similarly with both approaches. Learning to notice micro-level behaviors and their probabilistic nature was greater with the complexity approach. Analysis showed that only concepts that have less “micro–macro compatibility” were learned better with a complexity approach. Thus, a complexity approach helps separate the microbehaviors and then relate them to the macrobehaviors when these behaviors are dissimilar. We discuss how micro–macro compatibility helps point to concepts whose learning would benefit strongly from a complexity approach. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Given its importance, research on the validity of instruments specifically developed for LSA is still sparse, especially in science and its subdomains biology, chemistry, and physics. However, policy decisions for the improvement of educational quality based on LSA can only be helpful if valid information on students’ achievement levels is provided. In the present study, the nature of the measurement instruments based on the German Educational Standards in Biology is examined. On the basis of data from 3,165 students in Grade 10, we present dimensional analyses and report the relationship between different subdimensions of biology literacy and cognitive covariates such as general cognitive abilities and verbal skills. A theory-driven two-dimensional model fitted the data best. Content knowledge and scientific inquiry, two subdimensions of biology literacy, are highly correlated and show differential correlational patterns to the covariates.

Therefore, motivating students to become competent and engaged in science topics that are relevant for their everyday lives is an important goal, so they can be better citizens and decision makers with socioscientific issues (e.g., climate change and waste disposal). The present study contributes to research on activity emotions (state) and motivational outcomes (situational interest and situational competence) in science education. The study compared three experimental groups in a guided inquiry lab work on the chemistry of starch and a control group. The three groups were (i) 13 science classes taught at school; (ii) 14 classes taught in a Science Center Outreach Lab (SCOL) visit; and (iii) 17 classes taught in a combined setting of (i) and (ii); the groups were taught on the same topic. The large sample of classes was randomly assigned to the experimental conditions and a control group and data were analyzed for the theoretical part and the practical part of the intervention. The nested data were analyzed using item response theory and multilevel analyses. The three lab-work conditions were quite successful in comparison with the control group. There were some differences between the SCOL and school groups; the students experienced higher enjoyment in the theoretical part of the intervention in the school group and higher situational competence in the practical lab work at the combined setting. Especially low achievers profited from the intervention, supposedly because the topic was close to students’ everyday lives. Conscientiousness was a major predictor of emotional and motivational outcomes. In conclusion, experimental lab work at a SCOL can be seen as a supplement to a worthwhile STEM education. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Three self-reporting teacher instruments were used alongside their student achievement scores on the end-of-year state-science-test. The teacher self-reporting measures investigated technological literacy, ICT capabilities, and pedagogical beliefs about science inquiry pedagogy. Data were collected every year, and descriptive statistics, t-tests, and Pearson’s correlations were used for analysis. We found teachers’ technological skills and ICT capabilities increasing over time with significant gains each year. Additionally, teachers’ pedagogical beliefs changed to become more science inquiry oriented over time; however, the gains were not significant until after the second year of TPD. Comparisons of teacher learning and belief measures with student achievement revealed that the students’ performance was correlated to teachers’ pedagogical beliefs about science inquiry, but not to their technological skills nor to their ICT capabilities. This research suggests that pedagogical considerations should be foregrounded in TPD and that this may require more longitudinal TPD to ensure that technology integration in science instruction is consequential to student learning. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

An ongoing vexation facing science teacher educators is helping future elementary teachers overcome anxiety and negative associations with science due to their own school science experiences, while simultaneously encouraging innovative and ambitious teaching practice. Utilizing wonder as a pedagogical tool for emotional and aesthetic engagement with science holds promise as an entry point to connect future teachers with meaningful science content and practice. The link between wonder and science is well-articulated by successful scientists throughout history, and yet is rarely employed explicitly within elementary or teacher education science learning contexts. Forging a pedagogy of wonder demands connection to the emotive embodiment of science as a uniquely human process that nurtures our intense need to know. This qualitative case study is an effort to better understand if utilizing pedagogy intentionally focused on wonder could impact PSETs’ perceptions of science and scientific thinking.

Additional qualitative data analyses from classroom observations and case teacher interviews identified supportive teaching strategies (e.g. facilitating associative thinking, sharing impressive ideas, encouraging evidence-based conclusions, and reviewing and commenting on group presentations) for developing students’ creative science thinking. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

To identify which forms of automated guidance can be beneficial for inquiry learning, we compared reflective guidance to directive guidance for student-generated concept diagrams in web-based inquiry instruction. Eleven intact classes were randomly assigned to either a reflective guidance or a directive guidance condition. After creating a concept diagram showing energy flow in life science during the inquiry instruction, the directive group was told specific ways to improve their diagram, while the reflective group was told to revisit a relevant visualization step to locate useful information. The results from the concept diagrams, as well as individual tests, show that both forms of automated guidance helped students add target energy concepts, but reflective guidance was significantly more effective than directive guidance in improving students’ coherent understanding of how energy flows in life science. Analyses of log data revealed that the reflective group was more likely to revisit the visualization step as suggested in the guidance, which significantly enhanced student learning. Detailed analyses suggest that revisiting relevant materials to find useful information challenged students to identify gaps in their understanding and distinguish among multiple ideas. This study shows the value of designing reflective automated guidance for helping students engage in evidence-gathering practices and enhance their understanding of scientific concepts. The findings suggest promising directions for the design of automated adaptive guidance to support complex science learning. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, little research investigates special education teacher beliefs and practices around science in general or the nature of science and inquiry in particular. This investigation is a cross-case analysis of four elementary special education teachers' initial semester-long professional development experiences learning about and attempting to implement nature of science and inquiry instruction. Participants were purposively selected from a larger study of 61 pre-K-5 teachers from one mid-Atlantic urban school district. Data sources included pre/postsurveys, video recordings of lessons, teachers' guided reflections through time, and a postcourse interview. Results demonstrated that all participants improved their nature of science conceptions, explicitly addressed nature of science tenets during instruction, and taught via inquiry. Further, they moved beyond simply mimicking course lessons they experienced by adapting them to student needs and even innovating new lessons. Teachers increased their attention to plans and instruction to meet the needs of students with special needs; yet most of the teachers made few references to specific Individualized Education Programs, individual student needs, or associated instructional decisions. Results suggest that nature of science and inquiry professional development can increase special education teachers' expectations of their students with special needs. To improve outcomes, professional development should increase the explicit attention to planning and strategies to help meet specific student needs. Also, special and general education teachers in inclusion settings can benefit from support with the negotiation of their roles. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The target school of this study was inclusive, as it sought admission of students from varying backgrounds and levels of ability. Drawing from narrative inquiry and case study methodologies, we examine the collective work of the teachers in the target school from 6 months prior to school start-up through the end of the first year. We focus on visioning, collaboration, and curriculum development in our analysis of the teachers’ collective work. Results: We analyze the collective sense-making activity of the teaching staff regarding key facets of the start-up process. While the teachers received a variety of supports, including time and resources for collaborating, there was a lack of specific support for the conceptualization and creation of multi-disciplinary, STEM-focused projects. The risk-taking and collaborative actions of the teachers led to three specific instructional approaches that were continuously adjusted to respond to the evolving vision of the STEM-focused school. The teachers also solicited the needs and interests of their students and utilized these in curricular design and instruction, which promoted student buy-in and participation. By the end of the school year, a common vision for STEM-focused, project-based learning was emerging, but not solidified. Conclusions: Our study confirms the power of doing and risk-taking in teacher development, particularly in the ways in which teacher collaboration advanced curriculum and instruction in this STEM-focused school context. The intellectual supports that teachers require in this context are numerous and must be carefully identified and nurtured, and the subsequent teacher activity must be monitored as contextual shifts occur and sources of pressure (e.g., external learning standards) become relevant. The teachers’ role is a complex mixture of learner, risk-taker, inquirer, curriculum designer, negotiator, collaborator, and teacher. Instructional and curricular supports require substantial time to synthesize and eventually enact, and more than a few months prior to school start-up are necessary to fully engage and prepare teachers for the collective task of visioning, collaborating, and planning the curriculum and instruction of an innovative school. © 2016, Slavit et al.","Article","Scopus"

We designed a series of inquiry units assisted with three versions of written inquiry prompts (generic and context-specific); that is, three scaffold-fading conditions: implicit, explicit, and fading. We then examined how the three scaffold-fading conditions influenced students’ conceptual understanding, understanding of scientific inquiry, and inquiry abilities. Three grade-10 classes (N = 105) participated in this study; they were randomly assigned to and taught in the three conditions. Data-collection procedures included a pretest–posttest approach and in-depth observations of the target students. The findings showed that after these inquiry units, all of the students exhibited significant learning gains in conceptual knowledge and performed better inquiry abilities regardless of which condition was used. The explicit and fading conditions were more effective in enhancing students’ understanding of scientific inquiry. The fading condition tended to better support the students’ development of inquiry abilities and help transfer these abilities to a new setting involving an independent socioscientific task about where to build a dam.

We argue that the connection between environmental literacy and metacognition is theoretically promising. Therefore, we developed the Meta-CIC model, which is designed to develop students' environmental literacy, in parallel to supporting their metacognition. The core of this model is open inquiry-based learning. An explicit environmentally focused metacognitive guidance (Meta) was embedded within the inquiry setting. This guidance referred to the components of metacognition and the strands of environmental literacy. The model includes two levels of collaboration: the Collaborating Inquiry (CI), which refers to the interactions between a pair of students working on an inquiry project; and the Collaborating Inquiry Community (CIC), which refers to the interactions among pairs of students working on different projects. We investigated the contribution of the Meta-CIC model to students' expression of environmental literacy. For this purpose, 250 seventh and eight grade students, who conducted open inquiry projects throughout a full school year, participated in this research. We examined students' environmental literacy using two tools: an environmental literacy questionnaire, which adopts a positivist, outcome-based approach; and an innovative Environmental Literacy INventory (ELIN), which adopts a phenomenological process-based approach. The environmental literacy questionnaire served as pre- and post-test measurements. The ELIN was used to analyze students' reflections, following their involvement in the inquiry process. The results of this study provide supporting evidence for the theoretical relationship between metacognition and environmental literacy, and demonstrate the different effects of the Meta and the CIC components on students' expressions of environmental literacy. The results also point to the importance of providing explicit and context-based metacognitive support. This study highlights the importance of developing students' high order thinking and implementing the Meta-CIC model, within the framework of environmental education. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

However, preservice teachers show difficulties when experimenting. Previous research revealed that cognitive scaffolding promotes experimentation competency by structuring the learning process, while metacognitive and multimedia support enhance reflection. However, these support measures have not yet been tested in combination. Therefore, we decided to use cognitive scaffolding to support students’ experimental achievements and supplement it by metacognitive and multimedia scaffolds in the experimental groups. Our research question is to what extent supplementing cognitive support by metacognitive and multimedia scaffolding further promotes experimentation competency. The intervention has been applied in a two-factorial design to a two-month experimental course for 63 biology teacher students in their first bachelor year. Pre-post-test measured experimentation competency in a performance assessment. Preservice teachers worked in groups of four. Therefore, measurement took place at group level (N = 16). Independent observers rated preservice teachers’ group performance qualitatively on a theory-based system of categories. Afterwards, experimentation competency levels led to quantitative frequency analysis. The results reveal differing gains in experimentation competency but contrary to our hypotheses.

Data analysis was completed through structural equation modelling using a polychoric correlation matrix for data input and diagonally weighted least squares estimation. Adequate fit of the full model to the empirical data was realised.

The aim of the German youth science fair, Jugend forscht, is to encourage scientific thinking and inquiry methods such as experimentation. Based on 57 interviews with participants of the competition, this study summarises students’ conceptions and steps of learning about experimentation, taking into account age disparities. Five distinct subdomains of learning were identified in which learning processes may occur. These subdomains are procedure, purpose, material, control, and time. The three separate age groups used slightly different concepts but all the participants took the same or very similar steps of learning independent of their age. Two main reasons for conceptual developments could be detected: Firstly, the participating students had the opportunity to work using methodology similar to the commonly accepted scientific path of knowledge. Secondly, due to communication processes during the competition, a purposive reflection of their own project was promoted. With respect to different educational levels, experimentation proves to be a complex scientific framework that will be learnt step by step throughout students’ education. We therefore argue for a stronger anchoring of research experiments embedded in open or authentic inquiry to be included in science lessons at school. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The curriculum was implemented in 5 junior secondary schools in the context of a weeklong summer science course with 117 students. We first used a multi-level assessment approach to evaluate the students’ learning outcomes with the curriculum. Then, a path analysis approach was adopted for investigating at different assessment levels how the curriculum as a whole and how different types of inquiry units affected the students’ development of conceptual understandings and inquiry abilities. The results showed that the curriculum was effective in enhancing the students’ conceptual knowledge and inquiry abilities in the contexts of the six scientific topics. After the curriculum, they were able to construct interconnected scientific knowledge. The path diagrams suggested that, due to different instructional designs, the structured and guided inquiry units appeared to support the students’ learning of the topics in different ways. More importantly, they demonstrated graphically how the learning of content knowledge and inquiry ability mutually influenced one another and were reciprocally developed in a computer-based inquiry learning environment. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Achievement effects have been synthesized, but a systematic overview of attitude effects is missing. This study provides a meta analytic review based on 56 publications (1988–2014), reporting 65 independent experiments that investigated the effects of teaching approaches on student attitudes in primary or secondary science or mathematics education. Five types of teaching approaches were distinguished: inquiry-based, context-based, computer-based, collaborative learning strategies, and extra-curricular activities. Since many different attitude outcomes were distinguished and attitudes were assessed at different levels of granularity, we did separate analyses for specific and more global outcomes. Outcomes were not significantly different for different educational approaches. When taking all interventions together, significant effects were found for General Attitude (n = 60; d = 0.35), General Interest (n = 20; d = 0.22), and Career Interest in Science (n = 4; d = 0.40). The effects were significantly weaker for studies with older students. Analysis of achievement outcomes yielded a significant and large overall effect (n = 40; d = 0.78), again with no significant differences between teaching approaches. Although the positive effects might be partly due to novelty, the current findings do counter skepticism about the learning outcomes of interest-oriented teaching approaches. © 2016 The Authors","Article","Scopus"

The findings from this study indicate several areas of complementarity. Most often, the inquiry-based practices Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information, Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions, and Developing and Using Models were used to advance culturally responsive instruction and assessment. The use and development of models, in particular, allowed students to explore scientific concepts through families’ funds of knowledge and explain content from Western science and Indigenous Knowledge perspectives. Moreover, students frequently Analyzed and Interpreted Data when interrogating science content in sociopolitical consciousness-raising experiences, such as identifying pollution and asthma incidences in an urban area according to neighborhood location. Specific inquiry-based practices were underutilized when advancing culturally responsive science instruction, though. For example, Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking and Engaging in Argument from Evidence were infrequently encountered. However, culturally responsive engineering-related practices were most often connected with these, and thus, represent potential areas for future complementarity, particularly as the United States embraces the Next Generation Science Standards.

We measured student discourse, student performance, and perceptions of group work. We found that guided prompts were associated with higher-level discourse and higher performance (project scores) than open prompts. Students engaged in guided prompts were more likely to discuss distribution of labour and design/calculation details of their projects than when students responded to open prompts.

Numerous intervention studies have investigated how the control-of-variables-strategy (CVS) can be introduced to students. However, a meta-analysis of 72 intervention studies found that the opportunity to train CVS skills with hands-on tasks (g = 0.59) did not lead to better acquisition of CVS relative to interventions without a hands-on component (g = 0.74). We conducted an intervention study in which we investigated the differential effects of hands-on and paper-and-pencil training tasks on 161 eighth-grade students’ achievement. CVS was demonstrated to all students before they were grouped into a hands-on or a paper-and-pencil training condition. In both training conditions, students designed and interpreted experiments about which variables influence the force of electromagnets. Students in the hands-on group interacted with physical equipment while students in the paper-and-pencil group planned experiments using sketches and interpreted the outcome of experiments presented in photographs. We found no general advantage or disadvantage of hands-on tasks, as both groups did equally well on CVS and content knowledge tests. However, hands-on students outperformed paper-and-pencil students on a hands-on test identical to the training tasks, whereas the paper-and-pencil students outperformed hands-on students on a science fair poster evaluation task similar to the paper-and-pencil training. In summary, students learned task-specific procedural knowledge, but they did not acquire a deeper conceptual understanding of CVS or the content domain as a function of type of training.

The QuASSR contains 10 polytomous, two-tiered items crossed between two scenarios, and is based on theory suggesting a four-pronged structure for SSR (complexity, perspective taking, inquiry, and skepticism). In the context of pre-post measurement within a 1-week SSI-based unit on fracking, we found that the four sub-constructs represent a one-dimensional progression of ideas, and that SSR is largely independent of declarative knowledge. In the validation process, we discovered small inconsistencies in item functioning between scenarios in the areas of complexity and perspective-taking, but determined that resulting biases sat well within the uncertainty in students’ measures. In light of future development and use of the QuASSR, we determined that use of a single scenario is sufficient to produce a measurement reliability of 0.7. Given the time it takes for students to complete a scenario, we consider a 3-scenario QuASSR, and its accompanying measurement precision of 0.85, to be the practical upper precision limit of the QuASSR when used in experimental contexts. Finally, we found no significant change in SSR due to the SSI-based intervention. This mirrors prior reports of short-duration interventions targeting SSR. Our data suggest that as a cognitive construct underpinned by political, moral, and ethical ideologies around SSI, successful efforts to facilitate growth must target SSR as a central focus upon which more basic content knowledge is contextualized, so that sufficient instructional duration can be given to this important construct. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Studies of teacher self-reported enactment indicate that inquiry is used frequently in the classroom, suggesting a high level of proficiency with inquiry that would be amenable to inquiry reform. However, it is unclear whether the high frequency of self-report is based on sound knowledge inquiry. In the absence of sound knowledge, high rates of self-reported enactment would be suspect. We conducted a study to measure teachers’ knowledge of inquiry as it related to the known, high frequency of reported enactment. We developed a multidimensional survey instrument using US reform documents and administered it to 149 K–12 teachers at a national science teachers’ conference. The majority of the teachers surveyed did not report inquiry enactment based on well-structured knowledge of inquiry. Interviews with participants showed how teachers could readily map non-inquiry activities onto inquiry statements taken directly from reform documents. From these results we argue that teachers often believed they were enacting inquiry, when likely they were not. We further reason that teachers may struggle to interpret and enact inquiry-related requirements of science education reform and will need support distinguishing inquiry from non-inquiry practices. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

This paper describes outcomes associated with an inquiry-based out-of-school time science education program, Nuestro Futuro: Applied Science Education to Engage Black and Latino Youth (NFASE), which sought to build the capacity of middle school students of color to ‘think’ like health scientists from diverse disciplinary perspectives. The program was designed with the intent of (1) improving student attitudes toward and motivation for science and (2) increasing active and engaged citizenship (AEC). NFASE students explored health inequity and the social determinants of health locally and engaged in developing health promotion, outreach and education efforts targeted to their peers, parents/families, and community. Interest in the program was high overall, but implementation was not without challenges. Although evaluation outcomes indicate that there were no statistically significant changes in science-related attitudes or motivation, students reported significant increases in neighborhood social connection, as well as overall AEC. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

While a large body of literature addresses theoretical considerations, numerous empirical studies investigate scientific inquiry on quite different levels of detail and also on different theoretical grounds. Here, only little systematic research has analysed the different conceptualisations and usages of the overarching construct of scientific inquiry in detail. To close this gap, a review of the research literature on scientific inquiry was conducted based on a widespread approach to defining scientific inquiry as activities that students engage in. The main goal is to provide a systematic overview about the range and spectrum of definitions and operationalisations used with regard to single activities of the inquiry process in empirical studies. The findings from the review first and foremost illustrate the variability in the ways these activities have been operationalised and implemented. For each activity, studies differ significantly not only with respect to the focus, explicitness and comprehensiveness of their operationalisations but also with regard to the consistency of their implementation in the form of instructional or interventional components in the study and/or in the focus of the assessment of student performance. This has significant implications regarding the validity and comparability of results obtained in different studies, e.g. in the context of discussions concerning the effectiveness of inquiry-based instruction. In addition, the interrelation between scientific inquiry, scientific knowledge and the nature of science seems to be underexplored. The conclusions make the case for further theoretical work as well as empirical research. © 2016 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

According to the theories of educational evaluation and qualities of inquiry, four essential functions that inquiry-based tasks should serve are defined: (1) assisting in the construction of understandings about scientific concepts, (2) providing students opportunities to use inquiry process skills, (3) being conducive to establishing understandings about scientific inquiry, and (4) giving students opportunities to develop higher order thinking skills. An instrument–the Inquiry-Based Tasks Analysis Inventory (ITAI)–was developed to judge whether inquiry-based tasks perform these functions well. To test the reliability and validity of the ITAI, 4 faculty members were invited to use the ITAI to collect data from 53 inquiry-based tasks in the 3 most widely adopted senior secondary biology textbooks in Mainland China. The results indicate that (1) the inter-rater reliability reached 87.7%, (2) the grading criteria have high discriminant validity, (3) the items possess high convergent validity, and (4) the Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient reached 0.792.

Data was gathered by means of concept maps, which the students completed at four strategic stages of the learning process: beginning of 10th grade, end of 10th grade, end of 11th grade and end of 12th grade. At the end of the 3 year learning process, the students’ showed more complex system models. They included a wider range of concepts in their maps, spanning hierarchy levels ranging from the molecular and cellular to the system level. We also found an increase in references to dynamic interactions, but this did not encourage the students to use cellular level processes when explaining phenomena that occur at the systems level.

Nevertheless, research indicates that preservice elementary teachers have insufficient experience with this methodology and when they try to implement it, the theory they learnt in their university education clashes with the classroom practice they observe, a problem that has also been noted with other innovative methodologies. So, it appears essential for preservice teachers to conduct supportive reflective practice during their education to integrate theory and practice, which various studies suggest is not usually done. Our study shows how opening up a third discursive space can assist this supportive reflective practice. The third discursive space appears when preservice teachers are involved in specific activities that allow them to contrast the discourses of theoretical knowledge taught at university with practical knowledge arising from their ideas on science and science teaching and their observations during classroom practice. The case study of three pre-service teachers shows that this strategy was fundamental in helping them to integrate theory and practice, resulting in a better understanding of the inquiry methodology and its application in the classroom. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Article","Scopus"

In contrast to authentic scientific inquiry, in most simple inquiry tasks that are carried out in schools, the research questions are given to the students. Here, we characterized the teaching and learning of research-question-asking in the context of an innovative inquiry-oriented program for high-school biotechnology majors, focusing on two case studies of lessons in which students were expected to formulate their research questions. Results: In-depth examination of students’ questions, written during the two lessons, revealed that only in one of the lessons students’ ability to ask research questions improved. A connection was found between the more student-centered, dialogic, and interactive teaching strategy and the development of students’ ability to ask research questions in that class. Most of the research questions that were investigated by the students originated from a peer-critique activity during the student-centered lesson, unlike the teacher-focused lesson from which none of the students’ suggested research questions were selected for investigation. Conclusions: It can be concluded that a student-centered, dialogic, and interactive teaching strategy may contribute to the development of students’ ability to ask research questions in an inquiry-oriented high-school program. Encouraging teachers to implement dialogic and interactive classroom discourse in authentic inquiry could be a meaningful tool to support the teaching and learning of scientific abilities such as asking research questions. © 2016, The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

The programme began with a two-week summer Institute focused on both inquiry pedagogy and science content and continued with academic year support for participants' inquiry implementation. An inquiry teaching efficacy instrument was administered 3 times to 25 teacher participants to gauge changes in their personal self-efficacy and outcome expectancy across 5 essential features of classroom inquiry. To examine actual practices, pre/post classroom observations of the teachers' inquiry enactments were evaluated using a quality of inquiry observation protocol.

Teachers have been mandated to follow the new curriculum guidelines, known as Curriculum for Excellence (CfE), since the fall of 2010. The purpose of this study was to use a phenomenological lens to investigate how Scottish secondary science teachers are experiencing their work of curriculum development, including daily lesson design and more broadly, curriculum mapping within the context of reform (Remillard [1999], Curriculum Inquiry, 29: 315–342). We probed seven science teachers’ experiences to create both a composite profile of conscious thoughts about curriculum design and individual profiles that highlight interactions between the curriculum mandates, beliefs, and agentic orientations. The study indicated that changes to curriculum development required accepting new cognitive commitments including: (i) analyzing the CfE document to discern the most significant principles underlying change; (ii) reflecting on the ways that science teacher curriculum development is a problem-solving endeavor; (iii) undertaking the complex processes of curriculum mapping, from primary school all the way through national qualification exams; and (iv) recognizing that the epistemological frame for students’ science learning has changed and providing opportunities for students to create and apply knowledge. Two significant findings include the unpacking of these cognitive activities as part of a transformation toward a new epistemology of pedagogy, and the assertion that official curriculum documents can promote change, albeit with caveats concerning individual beliefs, agentic orientations, and possibilities for agency within school contexts. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Lack of conceptual clarity threatens construct validity, hampers theory development, and prevents science education researchers from focusing on the precise skills they wish to study and promote. To address these challenges, we argue for the expanded use of conceptual analysis, a traditional form of philosophical inquiry underutilized in science education research. After examining the historical and epistemological bases for this methodology, we introduce a variety of techniques used in this mode of inquiry including generic, differentiation, and conditions-type analyses using model, borderline, contrary, and invented cases. To further advance our argument, we then conduct an abbreviated differentiation-type analysis to distinguish “perspectives” from the related terms “orientations” and “positions,” three terms that present conceptual challenges in the research area of Socioscientific Issues (SSI) yet are clarified and contextually situated through this analysis. Finally, in light of our analysis, we suggest future directions for the expanded use of conceptual analysis in science education research. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Our study lends support to the assertion that inquiry- and content-focused PD, paired with classroom implementation, can effectively improve student learning. Our findings indicate that students improved in their nature of science (NOS) and aquatic science content knowledge and that these changes depended in some ways on the participating teachers’ characteristics and adherence to the program. The students’ improvements were amplified when their teachers adhered more closely to the PD activities during their classroom implementation. The teachers’ previous science PD experience and pre-PD understanding of inquiry-based teaching also explained some of the variability in student growth. In both NOS and content, students of teachers with less prior science-PD experience benefited more. Grade band also explained variation in student outcomes through interactions with teacher-characteristic variables. In high school, students of teachers with lower pre-PD inquiry knowledge appeared to learn more about NOS. Our results suggest that inquiry and content training through PD may minimize disparities in teaching due to inexperience and lack of expertise.

Scsience teachers’ subject matter knowledge (SMK) and the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) component of knowledge of students’ conceptions (KOSC) can be valuable resources for helping students learn difficult science concepts such as natural selection. However, little research exists that explores the relationship between science teachers’ SMK and their KOSC on evolution by natural selection. This study explores the relationship between SMK and KOSC through the participation of four biology teachers at a single high school and thus deepens our understanding of the teacher knowledge base. Main data sources are teacher interviews in which each teacher answered SMK-type questions and predicted what their students’ most common alternative conceptions were by using the Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection (CINS). Other data sources include student responses on the CINS and classroom observations. Findings revealed relative independence between SMK and KOSC, although there is likely a minimum threshold of SMK to recognize student alternative conceptions.

The term “agent” in the context of ABMs indicates individual computational objects or actors that obey simple rules assigned or controlled by the user. It is the interactions between these agents that give rise to emergent, aggregate-level behaviors in complex systems. While several researchers have argued for the effectiveness of ABMs for learning about complex systems, the design of classroom activity systems using ABMs, especially for elementary students, has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we report on a 2-week long proof-of-concept study conducted in a third-grade classroom of 15 students in which students began with an embodied modeling activity of foraging behavior, followed with the generation of mathematical inscriptions based on their embodied actions, and finally, conducted further inquiry of interdependence in an ecosystem using two separate ABMs. Furthermore, we show that the lens of mechanistic reasoning can be productively used to identify the process of students’ conceptual development of interdependence in an ecosystem as they engage in the modeling activities. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

This quantitative study explored how TAs’ content knowledge, beliefs about teaching, and teaching confidence change as a result of PD and how TAs’ prior experience, UTA/GTA status, content knowledge, beliefs, and teaching confidence relates to students’ content knowledge learning in an inquiry-based general chemistry laboratory. Participants included 14 GTAs, 5 UTAs, and their 529 students at a public university. PD supported TAs to lead inquiry-based general chemistry laboratory classes, involving a week-long workshop and 14 weekly follow-up meetings. Results demonstrate that TAs’ content knowledge improved following PD and teaching, t(18) = −3.62, p = 0.002, and students’ content knowledge significantly improved across the semester, t(528) = −36.27, p = 0.000, dCohen = 1.3. Further, TAs with higher content knowledge post-PD tended to have students with higher end-of-semester content (r = 0.517, p = 0.000). No differences existed between UTAs or GTAs on any TA characteristic or student outcome measure. Using a hierarchical linear regression model, student post-semester content knowledge was predicted by student demographics; however, no TA characteristics or demographics were significant predictors of student content knowledge. Students who perceived their TA as more supportive also believed they learned more content (r = 0.280, p =0.000). Thus, UTAs can be used in lieu of GTAs in our inquiry-based general chemistry laboratory context and could be a possible alternative for TA instructors at other universities. Continued work examining TA PD, TA characteristics, TA practice, and student learning in inquiry-based laboratory contexts is warranted. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Regarding the cognitive aspect, we examined to what extent the cognitive processes underlying the scientific skills and the disciplinary reasoning behind the content knowledge were taught. Regarding the social aspect, we examined how classroom discourse supported student learning in terms of students' opportunities to talk and interaction patterns. Our participants were 17 physics teachers who were actively engaged in teacher education programs in universities and professional development programs in local school districts. We analyzed one lesson video from each participating teacher. The results suggest both promises and challenges. Regarding the cognitive aspect of inquiry, the teachers in general recognized the importance of teaching the cognitive processes and disciplinary reasoning. However, they were less likely to address common intuitive ideas about science concepts and principles. Regarding the social aspect of inquiry, the teachers frequently interacted with students in class. However, it appeared that facilitating conversations among students and prompting students to talk about their own ideas are challenging. We discuss the implications of these findings for teacher education programs and professional development programs in China. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

The review, involving a constructionist thematic analysis of systematically searched and screened papers, identified the few empirical studies from that perspective, the vague operationalisation of intercultural relationship development, and the methodological limitations of the empirical work.

Treatment students received instruction related to air pollution (airborne particulate matter), associated health concerns, and training on how to operate air quality testing equipment. They then participated in a yearlong scientific research project in which they developed and tested hypotheses through research of their own design regarding the sources and concentrations of air pollution in their homes and communities. Results from an external evaluation revealed that treatment students developed a deeper understanding of scientific research than did comparison students, as measured by their ability to generate good hypotheses and research designs, and equally expressed an increased interest in pursuing a career in science.

Students’ performance in the design of relevant experiments was evaluated before and after an eight-week intervention compared to a control group, as well as the persistence of this learning after eight months. The study involved a quasi-experimental longitudinal study with pre-test/post-test/delayed post-test measures, complemented with semi-structured interviews with randomly selected students. Our findings showed improvement in the experimental design skills as well as its sustainability among students working with the inquiry-based sequence. After the intervention, students were able to establish valid comparisons, propose pertinent designs and identify variables that should remain constant. Contrarily, students in the control group showed no improvement and continued to solve the posed problems based on prior beliefs.

First, we aimed to replicate the findings of previous studies which had showed a substantial improvement on procedural and epistemological knowledge after direct instruction and their maintenance in time. Second, we aimed to examine the dynamic relationships of the procedural (control of variables strategy) and epistemological (nature of models) knowledge and the conceptual understanding of interrelated phenomena (floating–sinking) and subordinate abstract concepts (density) that have been developed to explain these phenomena across the learning process. A five-unit teaching learning sequence was organized and implemented in three 5th grade (N = 53) science classes. Participants answered at three time points—before, immediately following and 7 months after the implementation—in a questionnaire involving eight questions concerning the four abovementioned teaching and learning content areas. The collected data was used to test, with Path analysis, the validity of the theoretically designed model that depicted the causal relationships between the four areas. The inquiry-based activities were successful in bringing students’ ideas closer to the scientific knowledge. In addition, the model fitted in well with our data. So, the instruction of procedural and epistemological knowledge was crucial in the conceptual understanding of density in the frame of floating–sinking interpretation. In addition, understanding of the concept of density as a property of materials immediately following the implementation contributes significantly to students’ interpretations of floating–sinking phenomena even 7 months later. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Scopus"

We recommend educational researchers and scientists collaborate to create and refine curricula that utilise geospatial technologies, climate models and communication technologies to bring students into contact with scientists, climate data and authentic AGCC research processes.

This integration of practices and content requires sophisticated teaching that does not often happen in elementary classrooms. Educative curriculum materials - materials explicitly designed to support teacher and student learning - have been posited as a way to support teachers to achieve these ambitious goals, yet little is known about how elementary teachers actually use educative curriculum materials in their interactions with students. To address this gap, we used qualitative case study methods drawing mainly on videorecords of the enactments of lessons and teacher interviews to investigate how two fourth-grade teachers enacted a curriculum unit enhanced with educative features. Evidence of language and teaching moves promoted by the educative features was observed in the teachers' enactments. Findings suggest that variation existed in the teacher-curriculum interactions within and across teachers and across the suite of educative features. The teachers drew on educative features that contained representations of teacher and student work to envision possibilities for teaching the lesson while they used other features for identifying main ideas for the lesson.

While students typically view evidence as necessary for supporting scientific claims, they tend to objectify evidence, that is, they see it as self-evident and factual, rather than as constructed or open to interpretation (Driver, Leach, Miller, & Scott, 1996; Sandoval & Çam, 2011). In this paper, I introduce a perspective from the science studies literature—evidence construction as transformation—that might usefully guide closer analyses of students' work with evidence. I describe the problem of objectification of evidence and how it has been studied, developing an argument for studying in greater detail how evidence is constructed by classroom communities over the course of their work with investigations. The remainder of the paper shows how one framework was developed for this purpose and describes how it was applied to an empirical investigation conducted in a third grade classroom to understand what work was done to construct evidence and what roles teachers and students were playing in this work. I argue that this framework makes visible three important aspects of evidence construction: what epistemic work is done to construct evidence, whom this work is meaningful to, and what it is meaningful for. I end the paper by exploring potential implications for understanding the construction of an explanation in community activity, the development of students' facility with evidence construction, and the teacher's role in facilitating the construction of evidence. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper, we developed and validated the McGill Self-Efficacy For Inquiry Engagement (McSELFIE) instrument with undergraduate students in natural science disciplines. We defined inquiry engagement as carrying out the practices of science (POS) that are supported by students’ personality characteristics (SPCs) and that result in achieving inquiry-learning outcomes (ILOs). Based on these theoretical perspectives, the McSELFIE is a 60-item, learner-focused survey that addresses three components that are theoretically important for engaging in scientific inquiry: (a) SPCs, (b) ILOs, and (c) POS. Evidence for construct and content validity were obtained by using experts’ judgments and confirmatory factor analysis with a sample of 110 undergraduate students enrolled in science disciplines. Internal consistency of the factors and instrument was also examined. The McSELFIE instrument is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring science undergraduate students’ self-efficacy for inquiry engagement. Matched pairs analyses were conducted among the instruments’ factors. Students reported the highest self-efficacy for openness, applying knowledge, and carrying out investigations.

Even if teachers know the dynamics and complexity of living systems in biology and geography, they might not be able to effectively explain it to students. Teachers need an understanding of systems and their behaviour (content knowledge), and they also need to know how systems thinking can be fostered in students (pedagogical content knowledge (PCK)). But the effective development of teachers’ professional knowledge in teaching systems thinking is empirically uncertain. From a larger study (SysThema) that investigated teaching systems thinking, this article reports the effects of the three different interventions (technical course, didactic course and mixed course) in student teachers’ PCK for teaching systems thinking. The results show that student teachers’ PCK for teaching systems thinking can be promoted in teacher education. The conclusion to be drawn from our findings is that a technically orientated course without didactical aspects seems to be less effective in fostering student teachers’ PCK for teaching systems thinking. The results inform educators in enhancing curricula of future academic track and non-academic track teacher education. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

It compares the processes and outcomes of several types of professional learning opportunities within a Math and Science Partnership based on how well they facilitated productive communication, student-centered instructional practices, and knowledge negotiation. It discusses conflicts as components of faculty member/teacher interactions, regardless of the setting. However, when laboratory materials provide a relevant context for collaborative learning, and when there are opportunities for the development of microlevel interactional solidarity, conflicts can lead to knowledge negotiation rather than disengagement. Furthermore, these settings can reduce faculty members’ use of lecture-based approaches, mitigate status differences, and facilitate the development of reform-minded identities. This study suggests that while a focus on mutual learning is preferable to transmission in K-20 partnerships, it is important to consider that mutual learning may be a negotiated product emerging from conflict and dialogue rather than an unproblematic exchange of information. In addition, it suggests that K-20 partnerships should intentionally create opportunities that foster the establishment of goal-oriented temporary communities, as these can support persistence through conflicts, reform-minded teaching identities, and inquiry-based instruction. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

This longitudinal study examined pathways from parental stimulation of children’s curiosity per se to their science acquisition (SA). A latent variable of SA was indicated by the inter-related variables of high school science course accomplishments, career interest, and skill. A conceptual model investigated parental stimulation of children’s curiosity as related to SA via science intrinsic motivation and science achievement. The Fullerton Longitudinal Study provided data spanning school entry through high school (N = 118). Parental stimulation of curiosity at age 8 years comprised exposing children to new experiences, promoting curiosity, encouraging asking questions, and taking children to a museum. Intrinsic motivation was measured at ages 9, 10, and 13 years, and achievement at ages 9, 10, and 11 years. Structural equation modelling was used for analyses. Controlling for socio-economic status, parental stimulation of curiosity bore positive and significant relations to science intrinsic motivation and achievement, which in turn related to SA.

Ninety-two teachers in three states implemented our modified materials over six curricular units from two publishers: Holt (a reading-focused curriculum) and Full Option Science System (FOSS) (an inquiry-focused curriculum). Results were compared between two interventions—one based on selected principles of cognitive science (cognitive-science-based) that included instruction in diagram comprehension and one providing professional development in science content only (content-only)—and a business-as-usual control. We analyze posttest items involving different degrees of reliance on diagrams to show how instruction in diagram comprehension can improve comprehension of diagrams during reasoning. At the classroom level, there were significant advantages of the cognitive-science-based intervention over both content-only and business-as-usual with large effect sizes in all FOSS units (d = 0.41–0.52), but only one Holt unit (d = 0.11). Analyses by type of diagram suggested these effects were largest for transfer to diagrams from an uninstructed domain. Further analyses of high-stakes state test scores available for the participants implementing the Holt units showed improved use of diagrams (d = 0.45–0.66). Results suggest that making sense of visualizations (diagrams) is not effortless and self-evident, but that students who receive supports for comprehending can improve their comprehension, and the learning can transfer to new domains. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

European countries stress that science graduates are fundamental for economic growth. Nevertheless, there is a declining student participation in science. In response, there has been a call to change the way science is taught in schools, which focuses on inquiry methods rooted in constructivism. Universities and other organisations have responded by developing outreach programmes to improve student engagement in science. Given this context, there is a necessity for research to ascertain if this new relationship between outreach and education is worthwhile. This study examines and compares primary teachers and outreach practitioners understanding and perceptions of constructivist science pedagogy, in an effort to understand the potential of a teacher-outreach partnership. For this, qualitative and quantitative methods were employed, taking a dialectic pragmatic stance. Contradicting the recurrent view, teachers and outreach providers revealed favourable views in relation to constructivism, despite recognising barriers to its implementation. These results support a partnership between teachers and outreach practitioners and the realisation of the hybrid role of each participant. The results also reveal an important dynamic in outreach access to schools. Specifically, the outreach connected teachers acted as gatekeepers by negotiating access into their colleagues classrooms. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

The inquiry project positively affected several elements of teachers’ attitudes. Teachers felt less anxious about teaching science and felt less dependent on contextual factors compared to the control group. With regard to attitude towards conducting inquiry, teachers felt less anxious and more able to conduct an inquiry project. There were no effects on other attitude components, such as self-efficacy beliefs or relevance beliefs, or on self-reported science teaching behaviour. These results indicate that practitioner research may have a partially positive effect on teachers’ attitudes, but that it may not be sufficient to fully change primary teachers’ attitudes and their actual science teaching behaviour. In comparison, a previous study showed that attitude-focused professional development in science education has a more profound impact on primary teachers’ attitudes and science teaching behaviour. In our view, future interventions aiming to stimulate science teaching should combine both approaches, an explicit focus on attitude change together with familiarisation with inquiry, in order to improve primary teachers’ attitudes and classroom practices. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

In this study, we examined teacher customization of inquiry-based science lessons from an online lesson portal. We found that students who completed teacher-customized lessons had greater improvements in science content understanding than students who completed non-customized lessons. To expand upon this finding, we examined four case studies of teachers who made significant numbers of modifications to lessons: three ""high performers"" (with increases in student achievement ranging from 64th to 97th percentile) and one ""low performer"" (7th percentile). We found that high performing teachers modified lessons to include opportunities for students to revisit their predictions, engage in different learning modalities, and make deeper connections between scientific concepts. Changes made by the ""low performing"" teacher reduced the quality of the lesson, for example, asking students to predict results without sufficient context or information. These findings suggest that teacher customization can improve the quality of inquiry-based science lessons, but that some teachers may require additional training and support to achieve the benefits of customization. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The purpose of this study was to characterise the questioning practices of an experienced teacher who taught a curricular unit enhanced with educative features that emphasised students’ engagement in scientific practices integrated with science content. Analyses indicated the teacher asked four types of questions: explication questions, explanation questions, science concept questions, and scientific practice questions, and she used three questioning patterns including: (1) focusing students on scientific practices, which involved a sequence of questions to turn students back to the scientific practice; (2) supporting students in naming observed phenomena, which involved a sequence of questions to help students use scientific language; and (3) guiding students in sensemaking, which involved a sequence of questions to help students learn about scientific practices, describe evidence, and develop explanations.

Two secondary teachers and a total of 62 students participated in the study. Data included students' performance during the unit, pre- and post-unit tests, videos of the lessons, and teacher interviews. The findings showed that during the unit, the two classes' performances were significantly different.

This paper reports on design research to create a 30 hour professional development seminar focused on cultivating the interpretive power of early career teachers who teach science to students from historically non-dominant communities. Interpretive power refers to teachers’ attunement to (a) students’ diverse sense-making repertoires as intellectually generative in science and (b) expansive pedagogical practices that encourage, make visible, and intentionally build on students’ ideas, experiences, and perspectives on scientific phenomena. The seminar sought to integrate student sense-making, scientific subject matter, teaching practice, and matters of equity and diversity on the same plane of professional inquiry by engaging participants in: (a) learning plant science; (b) analyzing classroom cases; (c) experimenting with expansive discourse practices in their classrooms; and (d) analyzing their classroom experiments in relation to student sense-making and expansive pedagogy. Twenty-eight teachers participated in two cycles of design research. An interview-based transcript analysis task captured shifts in teachers’ interpretive power through their participation in the seminar. Findings showed that the teachers developed greater attunement to: complexity in students’ scientific ideas; the intellectual generativity of students’ sense-making; student talk as evidence of in-process, emergent thinking; and co-construction of meaning in classroom discussions. Findings also showed that participants developed deeper understanding of the functions of expansive teaching practices in fostering student sense-making in science and greater commitment to engaging in expansive practices in their classroom science discussions. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the elaborating prompt condition, students are prompted to write explanations that support the accepted theory of evolution. In the competing prompt condition, students are prompted to write explanations that differentiate two views of evolution associated with Darwin and Lamarck. Data sources included a pretest and posttest, an embedded item, observations, logged teacher guidance, and teacher interviews. Findings show similar pretest to posttest gains in students’ understanding of evolution for both conditions, but this pattern was not uniform across all three teachers. For one teacher, students who received competing theory prompts produced significantly higher gains than those who received elaborating theory prompts. A closer look at embedded student work reveals a higher degree of teacher participation (i.e., grading and guidance) than for the other teachers. Our findings illustrate how helping students distinguish between competing scientific claims can support learning in an inquiry unit, but may require a higher degree of teacher participation and reinforcement. We discuss the implications of these findings for enhancing students’ scientific explanations. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study explored how partnering scientists and students on a social media platform supported students’ development of disciplinary practice knowledge through practice-based learning with experts during two pilot enactments of a project-based curriculum focusing on the ecological impacts of climate change. Through the online platform, scientists provided feedback on students' infographics, visual argumentation artifacts that use data to communicate about climate change science. We conceptualize the infographics and professional data sets as boundary objects that supported authentic argumentation practices across classroom and professional contexts, but found that student generated data was not robust enough to cross these boundaries. Analysis of the structure and content of the scientists’ feedback revealed that when critiquing argumentation, scientists initiated engagement in multiple scientific practices, supporting a holistic rather than discrete model of practice-based learning. While traditional classroom inquiry has emphasized student experimentation, we found that engagement with existing professional data sets provided students with a platform for developing expertise in systemic scientific practices during argument construction. We further found that many students increased the complexity and improved the visual presentation of their arguments after feedback. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

Besides theoretical knowledge, such as concepts and formulas, practical work is considered to be an integral and basic part of science education. As practical work is perceived and understood in different ways, comparing the results between classes and schools is difficult. One way of making the results comparable is to develop systematic inquiries to be assessed in national large-scale tests. However, introducing similar testing conditions in a laboratory environment is not always possible. Although the instructions and assessment guides for such tests are detailed, many obstacles need to be overcome if equality in the overall test situation is to be achieved. This empirical case study investigates two secondary school science teachers’ assessments of 15–16 years old students in three separate groups in the practical part of a Swedish national test in chemistry. Data are gathered using two video cameras and three pairs of spy camera glasses. The results show that individual and independent assessments are difficult due to the social interactions that take place and the physical sources of errors that occur in this type of setting. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Article","Scopus"

This study investigates teachers' self-reported approaches to teaching science through inquiry. Phenomenographic interviews undertaken with 20 elementary teachers revealed teachers identified six approaches to teaching for inquiry, clustered within three categories. These approaches were categorized as Free and Illustrated Inquiries as part of an Experience-centered category, Solution and Method Inquiries as part of a Problem-centered category, and Topic and Chaperoned Inquiries as part of a Question-centered category.

The current study evaluates the effect of scaffolding on the invention processes and outcomes, given that students are not expected to succeed in their inquiry and that all students receive subsequent instruction. While socio-cognitive theories of learning advocate for scaffolding in inquiry activities, reducing students’ agency, and possibly their failure rate, may be counter-productive in this context. Two Invention activities related to data analysis concepts were given to 87 undergraduate students in a first-year physics lab course using an interactive learning environment. Guided Invention students outperformed Unguided Invention students on measures of conceptual understanding of the structures of the constructs in an assessment two months after the learning period. There was no effect, however, on measures of procedural knowledge or conceptual understanding of the overall goals of the constructs. In addition, Guided Invention students were more likely to invent multiple methods during the Invention process. These results suggest that the domain-general scaffolding in Invention activities, when followed by instruction, can help students encode deep features of the domain and build on their failures during Productive Failure.

Using an interpretivist perspective within a narrative inquiry approach, I focus on the student and science-student identities two African American boys constructed as they spoke about their participation in a science class that aimed to help them see themselves as people who can do science. I found that narratives offer opportunities to see the ways in which classroom and science structures become intertwined with children's agentic ways of developing for themselves a place in science. When children narrate science identities, they do not limit themselves to the content of the curricula, but meld together various ideas and experiences and draw on talents we may not have known they possessed. The power of self-authoring for African American boys is that it offers spaces in which they can weave together real and imaginary worlds and people to create spaces in which they are leaders and experts and, in the process, build pathways of resilience. Both of the boys in this study thought of themselves as ""smart"" or competent science people, but not in the ways we might expect. Their stories challenge us to listen more closely to the ways in which Black boys talk about themselves in relationship to science, peers, schooling, and ideas so that we can leverage the resources they bring to the learning of science. Participating in school science is more than a cognitive endeavor; it is also social and emotional. Science educators must conceive of not only how we might improve the science curriculum, but also the ways in which we facilitate the construction of children's images of themselves as they engage in this curriculum. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

This study, through direct observation and analysis, investigated content-related student interactions in an authentic inquiry based primary science class setting. Thirty-one upper primary students were videotaped working in cooperative inquiry based science activities. Cooperative talk and negotiation of the science content was analysed to identify any high-level group interactions. The data show that while all groups have incidences of high-level contentrelated group interactions, the frequency and duration of these interactions were limited. No specific pattern of preceding events was identified and no episodes of high-level content-related group interactions were immediately preceded by the teacher’s interactions with the groups. This in situ study demonstrated that even without any kind of scaffolding, specific skills in knowing how to implement cooperative inquiry based science, high-level content-related group interactions did occur very briefly. Support for teachers to develop their knowledge and skills in facilitating cooperative inquiry based science learning is warranted to ensure that high-level content-related group interactions and the associated conceptual learning are not left to chance in science classrooms. © 2016 The Author(s).","Article","Scopus"

The study was conducted in an upper secondary school, grounded in a school-based intervention research project. My contribution to the field of research on TPD is founded on the hypothesis that teachers would be best facilitated to make their practice more inquiry based if they are provided with a mediating artifact. In this study the artifact is a model 5E, which is a conceptual way of thinking, to help teachers reflect on their practice. The aim is to encourage teachers to make changes themselves, by applying extended use of inquiry into their practice. This mediated artifact could thus be used across different national contexts. The main research question is; how can the 5E model as a mediating artifact enhance TPD? The article addresses the processes of the use of the 5E model and its influence on teachers’ perception of the model. This is in order for teachers to conceptualize their goals related to inquiry and scientific thinking, and to solve the problems involved in achieving those goals in their own contexts. The study concludes that, after the intervention, the teachers' approaches and strategies demonstrate greater emphasis on learning. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Open coding techniques were used to analyze the data in order to construct categories and subcategories and eventually to identify emerging themes. The outcomes of the analysis showed that the inclusion of informal science experiences in the context of teacher preparation has the potential to support beginning elementary teachers' development of contemporary ideas about science teaching and learning related to inquiry-based science, the nature of scientific work and the work of scientists, connecting science with everyday life, and making science fun and personally meaningful.

Learning about SI comprises both the doing of science (process) and knowledge about the nature of scientific inquiry (NOSI). German reform documents promote inquiry generally but do not equally address these two sides of inquiry. This study explores how teachers incorporate learning about SI into laboratory work in the Chemistry classroom. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 secondary school Chemistry teachers (8 of them holding a Ph.D. in Chemistry) from Germany. The results indicate that teaching NOSI is not a primary goal for teachers. Still, some aspects of NOSI seem to be more easily incorporated in the Chemistry classroom, for example, critical testing and hypothesis and prediction. Teachers state 2 main criteria to identify suitable chemical laboratory work for teaching NOSI: adaptable parameters and low level of required content knowledge. Surprisingly, differences can be found between Ph.D. and non-Ph.D. teachers’ views on teaching inquiry. The findings of this study can be used to (a) select opportunities for targeted research on teaching NOSI in the Chemistry classroom, (b) inform curriculum material development and (c) give impetus to science teacher education and professional development. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

This paper explores whether middle-school students’ ability to engage in critical components of argumentation in science impacts science classroom learning. It also examines whether students’ willingness to do so attenuates or moderates that benefit. In other words, does one need to be both willing and able to engage critically with the discursive nature of science to receive benefits to learning? This study of middle-school students participating in four months of inquiry science shows a positive impact of argumentative sensemaking ability on learning, as well as instances of a moderating effect of one's willingness to engage in argumentative discourse.

Observations of post-secondary geoscience indicate students often maintain errant ideas about the earth, even after direct instruction. This qualitative case study documents model-building activities of students as they experienced classroom instruction that braids history, inquiry, and model-based-learning within the context of earth dynamics. Transcripts of students’ conversations, and their written work indicate students primarily employed model accretion to enhance their mental models. Instances of accretion were descriptive, pertaining to what their model consisted of, as opposed to how it explained the target phenomenon. Participants also conflated “continent” with “tectonic plate” and had difficulty attributing elastic properties – the mechanism for earthquakes – to rocks or “plates”. We assert that the documented learning difficulties resulted from use of the metaphor “tectonic plate”, reinforced by other everyday experiences and meanings. We suggest students need time with new models or concepts to develop strong descriptions before developing explanations. They need concrete experiences and explicit discussions concerning mapping those experiences to concepts. Lastly, because students often apply common meanings to scientific terms, we should not ask if they understand, but ask how they understand the concept. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

The results did not provide evidence that the high-structured condition leads to higher learning gains, yet it was found that pausing the group work during computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) to provide structure and feedback by the teacher at a whole-classroom plenary level significantly lowered the feelings of competence frustration.

Educators have indicated the importance of engaging students in knowledge-sharing activities during the inquiry learning process. In this study, a location-based augmented reality (AR) environment with a five-step guiding mechanism is developed to guide students to share knowledge in inquiry learning activities. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of promoting the knowledge sharing behaviors of students, an experiment has been conducted in an elementary school natural science course. The participants were 57 fourth-grade students from an elementary school in Northern Taiwan, divided into an experimental group of 28 students who learned with the AR-based approach and a control group of 29 students who learned with the conventional in-class mobile learning approach. The students' learning behaviors, including their movements in the real-world environment and interactions with peers, were recorded. Accordingly, the learning patterns and interactions of the two groups were analyzed via lag-sequential analysis and quantitative content analysis. It was found that, in comparison with the conventional inquiry-based mobile learning activity, the AR-based inquiry learning activity is able to engage the students in more interactions for knowledge construction.

Science teaching orientations and beliefs about science held by 237 preservice science teachers were gathered via content-specific vignettes and questionnaire, respectively, prior to participation in a UK-based teacher education program. Data presented support Didactic, Academic Rigor, conceptual change, activity driven, and inquiry orientations as intuitive teacher stances. The paper proposes a continuum for these five science teaching orientations, ordered by potential teaching quality that may be useful to science teacher educators. Even though all participants were qualified scientists, naïve beliefs about science were prevalent, with few examples of informed and partially informed beliefs. Alignment of orientations and beliefs shows that orientations override preservice teachers’ notions of science teaching. Therefore, a further recommendation based on these data is that preservice science teachers’ beliefs about science are regarded as a component of subject matter knowledge and excluded from science teaching orientations. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

We examined relations between the attitudes and learning goals of teachers and their students regarding the use of simulations in whole-class teaching, and how teachers implement these simulations in their teaching practices. We observed lessons presented by 24 physics teachers in which they used computer simulations. Students completed questionnaires about the lesson, and each teacher was interviewed afterwards. These three data sources captured implementation by the teacher, and the learning goals and attitudes of students and their teachers regarding teaching with computer simulations. For each teacher, we calculated an Inquiry-Cycle-Score (ICS) based on the occurrence and order of the inquiry activities of predicting, observing and explaining during teaching, and a Student-Response-Rate (SRR) reflecting the level of active student participation. Statistical analyses revealed positive correlations between the inquiry-based character of the teaching approach and students’ attitudes regarding its contribution to their motivation and insight, a negative correlation between the SRR and the ICS, and a positive correlation between teachers’ attitudes about inquiry-based teaching with computer simulations and learning goal congruence between the teacher and his/her students. This means that active student participation is likely to be lower when the instruction more closely resembles the inquiry cycle, and that teachers with a positive attitude about inquiry-based teaching with computer simulations realize the importance of learning goal congruence. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

This system utilizes analysis of spatial features (e.g., slope of a line) to evaluate potential student ideas represented within graphs. Student ideas are then scored with rubrics based upon the knowledge integration framework (Linn & Eylon, 2011). We tested the effectiveness of this system on graphs constructed by 397 8th-12th grade students preceding, during, and following a curriculum focusing on graphs of motion. Comparison with human-coded responses indicates that the automated scoring system is very accurate (κ = 0.9). Also, ideas represented in constructions were generally similar to those demonstrated in written explanations; although individual students often shifted ideas between items. Learning gains were similar in both written and graph construction formats. Overall, these results suggest that graph construction is a valid and efficient means of evaluating students' complex ideas about data representation in science.

It requires fitting the culture of the classroom with the teacher's teaching and inquiry practices. To understand the interactions between these variables in relation to student learning, we conducted an investigation in two different classroom settings to understand how different teachers use and appropriate the same physical and computer-based tools into their teaching practices. Each worked with physical aquaria, function-oriented hypermedia for background information and reference, and NetLogo (Evanston, IL) simulations for computer-supported collaborative inquiry learning. The students engaged in inquiry as they used the NetLogo models in small groups. Because of distinct teaching styles and varying levels of comfort with the materials and content, these two enactments were extraordinarily different between the two classrooms. We present a contrasting case analysis to examine how each teacher's practices set the stage for the kinds of interactions that occurred during students' computer-supported inquiry learning. We suggest that one teacher worked from a cognitive-elaboration perspective whereas the other teacher took an approach to teaching that incorporated socio-cultural perspectives. Both of the approaches to teaching supported the active engagement of learners and may account for the similar learning outcomes measured. In light of the current move toward standards-based public education, it may seem that there is only one pathway for teaching to support of student learning. However, our results do not support this notion and we provide evidence that different instructional models, classroom norms, and appropriation of tools can support similar student learning outcomes with respect to content knowledge. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

By studying the inter-relationship between multiple learning modalities and phases of inquiry, we wished to illuminate possible dynamics between science inquiry and literacy in an integrated science approach. Six teachers and their students were recruited from a professional development course for the current classroom study. The teachers were to try out the Budding Science teaching model. This paper presents an overall video analysis of our material demonstrating variations and patterns of inquiry-based science and literacy activities. Our analysis revealed that multiple learning modalities (read it, write it, do it, and talk it) are used in the integrated approach; oral activities dominate. The inquiry phases shifted throughout the students' investigations, but the consolidating phases of discussion and communication were given less space. The data phase of inquiry seems essential as a driving force for engaging in science learning in consolidating situations. The multiple learning modalities were integrated in all inquiry phases, but to a greater extent in preparation and data. Our results indicate that literacy activities embedded in science inquiry provide support for teaching and learning science; however, the greatest challenge for teachers is to find the time and courage to exploit the discussion and communication phases to consolidate the students' conceptual learning. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

In recent years, the teaching and learning argumentation (i.e. the coordination of evidence and theory to support or refute an explanatory conclusion, model or prediction) has emerged as a significant educational goal. Argumentation is a critically important discourse process in science and it should be taught and learned in the science classroom as part of scientific inquiry and literacy. Argumentation stresses the evidence-based justification of knowledge claims, and it underpins reasoning across STEM domains. Our aim in this study was to investigate how argumentation has been positioned within the publications of three top academic journals: Science Education, International Journal of Science Education, and Journal of Research in Science Teaching. A methodology for content analysis of the journals is described using quantitative and qualitative techniques. Results: One of the contributions of our analysis is the illustration that researchers studying argumentation from a linguistic perspective have been emphasizing related concepts in different ways. While the emphasis has been on discourse and discussion across all journals, the related concepts of talk, conversation, dialogue and negotiation were observed to a lesser extent. Likewise, the fine-level analysis of the key epistemic concepts such as reasoning, evidence and inquiry indicates variation in coverage. Conclusions: The findings can provide evidence-based indicators for where more emphasis needs to be placed in future research on argumentation, and in particular they can provide guidelines for journals in soliciting articles that target underemphasized aspects of argumentation in science education. © 2015, Erduran et al.; licensee Springer.","Article","Scopus"

Taking a cue from school effectiveness research and reframing our approach using systems thinking, this study examined school-level variables associated with equitable science achievement. In particular, this study explores the concept of trust in relation to science education. Building upon a substantial body of research literature, we offer refined conceptualizations of schoolwide trust along with the findings that trust fluctuates according to the type of interpersonal relationship, that teacher views of the school principal's trustworthiness are considerably more variable than views of fellow teachers’ trustworthiness, and that schoolwide science achievement is associated with perceptions of the school principal's trustworthiness. This study supports the view that trustworthy professional relationships are one of several complementary organizational resources that promote effective and equitable science education. Moreover, our study identified aspects of school trust corresponding to school-level student science outcomes, and these differed from results reported elsewhere for math and reading/language-arts achievement. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

A total of 94 treatment students and 194 comparison students from four randomized intermediate schools participated in the current project. The intervention consisted of ongoing professional development and specific instructional science lessons with inquiry-based learning, direct and explicit vocabulary instruction, and integration of reading and writing. Results suggested that (a) there was a significantly positive treatment effect as reflected in students' higher performance in district-wide curriculum-based tests of science and reading and standardized tests of science, reading, and English reading fluency; (b) males and females did not differ significantly from participating in science inquiry instruction; (c) African-American students had lower chance of sufficiently mastering the science concepts and achieving above the state standards when compared with Hispanic students across gender and condition, and (d) below-poverty African-American females are the most vulnerable group in science learning. Our study confirmed that even a modest amount of literacy integration in inquiry-based science instruction can promote students' science and reading achievement.

As CVS is a prominent component of science standards appropriate assessment instruments are required to measure these scientific reasoning skills and to evaluate the impact of instruction on CVS development. A detailed review of existing CVS instruments suggests that they utilize different, and only a few of the four, critical CVS sub-skills in the item development. This study presents a new CVS assessment instrument (CVS Inventory, CVSI) and investigates the validity of student measures derived from this instrument utilizing Rasch analyses. The results indicate that the CVSI produces reliable and valid student measures with regard to CVS. Furthermore, the results show that the item difficulty depends on the CVS sub-skills utilized in item development, but not on the item content. Accordingly, previous instruments that are restricted to a few CVS sub-skills tend to over- or underestimate students’ CVS skills. In addition, these results indicate that students are able to use CVS as a domain general strategy in multiple content areas. Consequences for science instruction and assessment are discussed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Students' scores on multiple-choice pretest and posttest and worksheets for five inquiry-based activities were analyzed. The results show that the students' content knowledge in all conditions significantly increased from the pretest to posttest. Incorporating cognitive prompts with the explanation scaffolds better facilitated knowledge integration and resulted in greater learning gains of content knowledge and better quality evidence and reasoning. The metacognitive evaluation instruction improved all explanation components, especially claims and reasoning. This metacognitive approach also significantly reduced students' over- or underestimation during peer-evaluation by refining their internal standards for the quality of scientific explanations. The ability to accurately evaluate the quality of explanations was strongly associated with better performance on explanation construction. The cognitive prompts and metacognitive evaluation instruction address different aspects of the challenges faced by the students, and show different effects on the enhancement of content knowledge and the quality of scientific explanations. Future directions and suggestions are provided for improving the design of the scaffolds to facilitate the construction of scientific explanations. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

To address this need, we conducted an exploratory multiple-case study using qualitative research methods to investigate six 3rd-grade teachers’ pedagogical reasoning and classroom instruction around modeling practices (construct, use, evaluate, and revise) and epistemic considerations of scientific modeling (generality/abstraction, evidence, mechanism, and audience). Study findings show that all teachers emphasized a subset of modeling practices—construction and use—and the epistemic consideration of generality/abstraction. There was observable consistency between teachers’ articulated conceptions of scientific modeling and their classroom practices.

Three phases of coding were applied: (a) how design represents any of the seven domains of TPACK knowledge (Pedagogical, Content, Technological, Technological Pedagogical, Technological Content, Pedagogical Content or Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge); (b), how design talk represented three aspects of reasoning (external priorities, practical concerns and existing orientations); and (c), and what levels of inquiry are reached (no-depth; sharing ideas; analyze; and plan). Findings indicate that design talk reflects moments in which teachers reach deeper levels of inquiry. Findings also indicate that TPACK was mostly linked to expressing practical concerns. However when engaging in deeper inquiry, teachers existing orientations featured more prominently in the conversations. External priorities hardly seemed to play any role in design talk. Also, when addressing TPACK or PCK, design talk mostly reflects practical concerns. Pedagogy was addressed not as a single knowledge domain, rather in conjunction with the other two domains. Practical implications are discussed regarding how to support teachers during collaborative design. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

The current inquiry tested an educational application of this 'self reference effect' (SRE) on memory. A self-referential modification of literacy tasks (vocabulary spelling) was tested in two experiments. In Experiment 1, seven-to nine-year-old children (N = 47) were asked to learn the spelling of four nonsense words by copying the vocabulary and generating sentences. Half of the children were asked to include themselves as a subject in each sentence. Results showed that children in this self-referent condition produced longer sentences and increased spelling accuracy by more than 20%, relative to those in an other-referent condition. Experiment 2 (N = 32) replicated this pattern in real-word learning.

The students and instructor interviews, video recordings and class observations over an entire engineering drawing course were collected for data analysis with the use of a coding scheme derived from the presences. The findings revealed that attainment of the intended learning outcomes relied more on the teaching presence than on the social and cognitive presences of the approach.

Insufficient understanding of NOS can be associated with the ineffectiveness of curricular or instructional approaches. Consequently, researchers have begun to examine ways to improve students’ understanding of NOS. In this study, we purposely focused on honored students who major in the sciences to see whether extended science programs develop better understanding of NOS. We aimed to understand the relationship between science instruction and students’ NOS understanding in Israeli science advanced placement courses. Semi-structured interviews with science teachers provided data about the instruction of science in general, and NOS instruction in particular. An open-ended questionnaire that dealt with global climate change assessed students’ understanding of NOS. Results: Teachers reported about limited and implicit instruction about NOS. Although teachers believed that teaching NOS is important, the need for their students to succeed in the high-stake matriculation exams and the fact that these exams do not include questions dealing with NOS were indicated as the main reasons for the teachers’ reluctance to teach NOS. Nevertheless, we found a small overall improvement in students’ understanding of NOS. Two possible factors probably contributed to students’ improved understanding of NOS: conducting inquiry projects and teaching cases in history of science. Yet, in both contexts, the understanding improved only in one aspect of NOS. Conclusions: The small improvement in understanding NOS reflects the limited and non-systematic teaching of NOS. Implicit instruction is not effective enough to promote understanding of NOS, even in advanced 2-year science program, where both students and teachers are highly capable. Other factors that could explain the little improvement are insufficient subjects in the curriculum that emphasize NOS and teaching methods that do not encourage discussion about NOS. © 2014, Kahana and Tal; licensee Springer.","Article","Scopus"

Data sources included a test of inquiry practices, a questionnaire of metacognition, and worksheets. The results showed that the mixed cognitive and metacognitive prompts had significant impacts on the students’ inquiry practices, especially their planning and analyzing abilities. Furthermore, the mixed prompts appeared to have a differential effect on those students with lower level metacognition, who showed significant improvement in their inquiry abilities. A combination of cognitive and metacognitive prompts during an inquiry cycle was found to promote students’ inquiry practices. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Making is promoted as advancing entrepreneurship, developing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce, and supporting compelling inquiry-based learning experiences for young people. In this paper, we focus on making as an educative inquiry-based practice, and specifically tinkering as a branch of making that emphasizes creative, improvisational problem solving. STEM-rich tinkering activities are designed to support interdisciplinary investigations and creativity using a STEM-rich palette of tools, concepts, and phenomena. To date, the majority of research on making has focused on analysis of makerspaces, maker communities, and design and implementation of maker activities. In this paper, we describe a study that documented dimensions of learning in tinkering programs designed for museum visitors.

The current study is an inquiry-based research. It aims to describe and examine projects and activity stations for preschoolers in a Turkish preschool classroom bringing together the pieces of the puzzle of science education, called here ‘Hands–Heads–Hearts-on Science Education'. The study, conducted from a qualitative-interpretivist paradigm, reveals that activity stations and projects create a context for hands-on (active engagement), heads-on (inquiry based or mental-engagement), and hearts-on (interest based) science education. It is found that activity stations and projects, when maintained by appropriate teacher-support, create a playful context in which children can be actively and happily engaged in science-related inquiry. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

One of the underlying reasons is that its success can be significantly improved due to the recent technical developments that allow the inquiry process to be supported by electronic learning environments. Inquiry-based learning is often organized into inquiry phases that together form an inquiry cycle. However, different variations on what is called the inquiry cycle can be found throughout the literature. The current article focuses on identifying and summarizing the core features of inquiry-based learning by means of a systematic literature review and develops a synthesized inquiry cycle that combines the strengths of existing inquiry-based learning frameworks. The review was conducted using the EBSCO host Library; a total of 32 articles describing inquiry phases or whole inquiry cycles were selected based on specific search criteria. An analysis of the articles resulted in the identification of five distinct general inquiry phases: Orientation, Conceptualization, Investigation, Conclusion, and Discussion. Some of these phases are divided into sub-phases. In particular, the Conceptualization phase is divided into two (alternative) sub-phases, Questioning and Hypothesis Generation; the Investigation phase is divided into three sub-phases, Exploration or Experimentation leading to Data Interpretation; and the Discussion phase is divided into two sub-phases, Reflection and Communication. No framework bringing together all of these phases and sub-phases was found in the literature. Thus, a synthesized framework was developed to describe an inquiry cycle in which all of these phases and sub-phases would be present. In this framework, inquiry-based learning begins with Orientation and flows through Conceptualization to Investigation, where several cycles are possible. Inquiry-based learning usually ends with the Conclusion phase. The Discussion phase (which includes Communication and Reflection) is potentially present at every point during inquiry-based learning and connects to all the other phases, because it can occur at any time during (discussion in-action) or after inquiry-based learning when looking back (discussion on-action). © 2015 The Authors.","Review","Scopus"

These aim to develop students learning of science through approaches which reflect the authenticity of science as practiced by professional scientists while being practical and manageable within the school context. This paper offers a collection of our current reflections and suggestions concerning inquiry and its place in science education. We suggest that many of the current models of inquiry are too limited in their vision concerning themselves, almost exclusively, with producing a scaffold which reduces the complex process of inquiry into an algorithmic approach based around a sequence of relatively simple steps. We argue that this restricts students’ experience of authentic inquiry to make classroom management and assessment procedures easier. We then speculate that a more integrated approach is required through an alternative inquiry model that depends on three dimensions (conceptual, procedural and personal) and we propose that it will be more likely to promote effective learning and a willingness to engage in inquiry across all facets of a students’ school career and beyond. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Results showed that the learners held more informed views than that reported in previous international studies, except for particularly naive views regarding multiple methods of investigation.

PlantingScience (PS), an ideal curriculum for use as an NGSS model, is a computer-mediated collaborative learning environment intertwining scientific inquiry, classroom instruction, and online mentoring from scientists. With implementation in hundreds of classrooms across the United States, science teachers have noted PS as successful in motivating their students to engage in classroom inquiry investigations. To investigate the role of the online scientist-mentors in motivating students in the PS learning environment, we used self-determination theory (SDT) to guide a multiple case study of 10 student inquiry teams engaged in PS in a rural public school in a large Southwestern U.S. state. We used online dialogues between scientist-mentors and their assigned student inquiry teams to answer research questions about the motivational support provided by scientist-mentors and the association between this support and students' engagement in scientific inquiry. Analyses revealed a general relationship between scientist-mentor motivational support and student inquiry engagement. Differences were observed in the specific ways in which scientists supported autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Student inquiry engagement corresponded to high support in relatedness, whereas correspondence with autonomy support was low. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Such opportunities begin with elementary teachers implementing coherent and well-sequenced inquiry-based investigations in their classrooms. This study explored how preservice teachers (N = 30) planned inquiry-based investigations for elementary students. The preservice teachers spent the first 5 weeks of their methods course participating in astronomy investigations and then pair-taught astronomy investigations once a week for 5 weeks to elementary students in afterschool programs. We analyzed lesson plans, teaching reflections, and pre/post astronomy content assessments. One-third of the pairs developed coherent science inquiry investigations across all of their lessons. Their reflections suggest that preservice teachers who developed coherent inquiry investigations held normative ideas about scientific inquiry and were more likely to reflect on sense-making practices than preservice teachers who did not plan for coherent science inquiry investigations in their lessons. Preservice teachers' postinstruction astronomy content knowledge was positively correlated with an increased number of lessons spent on coherent science inquiry investigations. Based on our findings, we recommend engaging preservice teachers in coherent science inquiry investigations in a single domain followed by opportunities to plan and teach elementary children in that domain. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Customizing—making small adjustments to tailor given materials to particular situations and settings—is one design activity in which busy teachers can feasibly engage. Research indicates that customizations based in evidence from student work lead to improved learning outcomes. In this paper, we examine the customizations of four middle and high school teachers during their enactments of web-based inquiry science units. We examine how specific technology features afforded their customizations by providing tools for making adaptations and by making student work available as evidence for those adaptations. Cases built from classroom video and field note observations, interviews, and teachers’ curriculum artifacts, revealed three kinds of customizations: (a) devising timely instructional interventions to provide individualized guidance; (b) planning activities and adjusting milestones to align with students’ progress; (c) modifying existing materials to better integrate content into overall curriculum plans; and (d) incorporating scaffolds to better address students’ needs. We also identified three technology features that supported teachers’ customizations: (1) a system that logs student work for teachers’ inspection; (2) tools for conducting dynamic, formative assessment; and (3) an authoring environment that supports the re-design of units at multiple levels of granularity. We end by suggesting design principles for curriculum materials that support teachers’ customizations, as well as future directions for technology that would enhance teachers’ participation as designers. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Article","Scopus"

However, scientific modeling practices are rarely included within elementary science learning environments and disciplinary content is often treated as discrete pieces separate from scientific practice. Elementary students have few, if any, opportunities to reason about how individual organisms, such as plants, hold critical relationships with their surrounding environment. The purpose of this design-based research study is to build a learning performance to identify and explore the third-grade students’ baseline understanding of and their reasoning about plant–ecosystem relationships when engaged in the practices of modeling. The developed learning performance integrated scientific content and core scientific activity to identify and measure how students build knowledge about the role of plants in ecosystems through the practices of modeling. Our findings indicate that the third-grade students’ ideas about plant growth include abiotic and biotic relationships. Further, they used their models to reason about how and why these relationships were necessary to maintain plant stasis. However, while the majority of the third-grade students were able to identify and reason about plant–abiotic relationships, a much smaller group reasoned about plant–abiotic–animal relationships. Implications from the study suggest that modeling serves as a tool to support elementary students in reasoning about system relationships, but they require greater curricular and instructional support in conceptualizing how and why ecosystem relationships are necessary for plant growth and development. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

The analyses indicated that although respected pedagogical principles underlie teaching, students' use their own prior concepts to a limited degree to express their developing understanding of inquiry into scientific phenomena and ideas. The analyses showed how the teachers emphasized theoretical knowledge and hoped to enable the students to correctly interpret their observations and apply scientific theory. However, this emphasis hindered students' articulations of their developing understanding.

This study compares two collaborative critique activities using a Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), a form of concept map. Four classes of high school biology students (n = 81) using an online inquiry-based learning unit on evolution were assigned to one of two conditions. Student dyads in one condition compared their concept maps against an expert map while dyads in the other condition conducted a peer-review. Analysis of the concept maps suggests that students in both conditions improved their understanding of evolution from pretest to posttest. However, the two conditions lead to different criteria: Students in the expert-map condition focused mostly on concept-focused criteria like concept classification while students in the peer-review condition used more link-focused criteria like link labels and missing connections. This paper suggests that both forms of KIM critique activities can be beneficial for constructing more coherent connections across different topics in evolution education. These results support the value of collaborative KIM critique activities and help clarify the forms of collaborative activities that are most likely to be effective to facilitate knowledge integration processes. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

In this study, we examined the relationship between design behaviors and scientific explanations. Data on student design processes were collected as students engaged in a project on designing energy-efficient buildings on a blank square city block surrounded by existing buildings using a computer-aided design program, Energy3D, with built-in solar energy simulation capabilities. We used criterion sampling to select two highly reflective students among 63 high school students. Results: The main data sources were design replays (automatic playback of student design sequences within the CAD software) and electronic notes taken by the students. We identified evidence of informed design such as problem framing, idea fluency, and balancing benefits and trade-offs. Opportunities for meaningful science learning through engineering design occurred when students attempted to balance design benefits and trade-offs. Conclusions: The results suggest that design projects used in classrooms should emphasize trade-off analysis and include time and resources for supporting trade-off decisions through experimentation and reflection.

Results show that the training course had profound positive effects on primary teachers' professional attitude towards teaching science. Teachers improved in self-efficacy beliefs regarding science teaching, felt less dependent on context factors, and enjoyed science teaching more.

The trend in recent reform documents, unfortunately, ignores much of the research on NOS and SI and implicitly presumes that the ""doing"" of inquiry is sufficient for developing understandings of SI. The VASI serves as a tool in further discrediting this contention and provides both the classroom teacher and the researcher a more powerful means for assessing learners' conceptions about essential aspects of SI, consonant with the vision set forth in the recently released Next Generation Science Standards (Achieve, Inc., 2013). © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

This approach has challenges, as interest in a topic may not necessarily indicate interest in scientific practices and pursuits. An underexplored and perhaps productive way to gauge and foster interest in science is to understand the ways in which students express curiosity about the nature of an object, phenomena, or a given topic. This study explores the nature and prevalence of students' expressions of science-relevant curiosity such as wonderment about causal mechanisms, teleological explanations, and inconsistencies in observations. We coded student photojournal entries and interview responses to explore (1) how wonderment can be characterized not by science topic or domain, but rather by the aspects of scientific inquiry practice they reflect, (2) the variation in such science-relevant curiosity expression in a small sample (N = 19) of sixth-grade students, and (3) how individual variation in curiosity expression relates to reported interest in science. We found that a qualitative approach using photojournaling and interviews captured a wide variation in curiosity expression among students, and brief cases analyses (N = 3) demonstrate that students with differing patterns of curiosity expression talk about their interest in science differently. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

We designed a multimedia-based assessment for secondary school students that focused on scientific inquiry abilities (i.e., questioning, experimenting, analyzing, and explaining). Through the participation of 1218 students (561 8th graders and 657 11th graders), the balanced arrangement of test booklets, and the use of a generalized partial credit Rasch model, this study aimed at investigating how the modality of representations for item presentation (i.e., dynamic and static) and type of visual information (i.e., context and content) conveyed by the representations affected the item difficulty of the multimedia-based assessment. The results showed that overall items became slightly more difficult for students when the item presentation was static. Also, the interaction effect between modality and grade was significant; when item presentation was changed from dynamic to static, the items became easier to the 8th graders, whereas they were more difficult to the 11th graders. The results suggested that older students might have more cognitive resources to retrieve information from dynamic displays to solve the assessment tasks successfully. Additionally, while all interactions between modality and type of information on items with context visuals were not significant, there were significant interactions on four items with content visuals. A further examination of the items suggested that the tasks and the phenomena involved in the items may influence how modality affected the item difficulties when content visuals were used. These results implied that researchers need to pay special attention on the design of content visuals because they appear to be more influential than context ones to students' performances of science assessments. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus"

Instead, teachers must invest in a continuous and gradual process of long-term growth in students' capacity to think and act scientifically. Scholars call this investment taking a developmental approach to learning. It stands to reason that developmental approaches would involve teachers in different ways of thinking about instruction compared to short-term, accumulation approaches. Yet, little is understood about these potentially new ways of thinking (for us, ""views""). Therefore, we conducted a qualitative study to describe and illustrate ways in which teachers' views of instruction can be developmental. The study was based on interviews with 12 teachers about their experiences of using a curriculum that was developmentally oriented in that it prioritized gradual deepening of intellectual capacity. Selecting three teachers whose views of teaching and learning offered maximum contrast in their degree of developmental orientation, we analyzed their interview transcripts to reveal essential characteristics of a developmental view of instruction in our context. When taking a developmental view, teachers (i) saw students as learning to be scientists; (ii) prioritized big ideas; (iii) saw learning as immersion; and (iv) expected gradual improvement. We combined these elements to propose a general model for a developmental view of teaching and learning: believing in transformative outcomes and investing in the process of gradual change. We argue that these findings provide useful and informative ideas for understanding ways in which teachers can effectively approach instruction in the current era of reform. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In light of considerable research that has examined teachers' subject matter knowledge structures and their classroom practices (e.g., Gess-Newsome&Lederman, 1993, 1995), what was conspicuously absent was an assessment of teachers' knowledge structures for NOS and SI. The current investigation inferred the classroom practice knowledge structures for NOS and SI for four physics teachers. These results were then compared to responses communicated through the Knowledge Structures for NOS and SI (KS4NS) questionnaire and subsequent interview. The degree of congruence between the two knowledge structures was gauged at the level of included concepts, connections between concepts, and for other organizational or thematic elements. The results indicated limited congruence between teachers' knowledge structures for NOS and SI and those espoused in their classroom practice. Most notable was the dearth of connections evidenced between constituent aspects in the latter. The necessity of having teacher candidates explicitly reflect on the structure of the subject matter they are learning for teaching is reiterated through the findings of the current study. The utility of the KS4NS as tool to foster such reflections specifically regarding conceptualization of NOS and SI independent of, or in conjunction with, traditional subject matter also warrants further investigation, particularly in light of the recently released Next Generation Science Standards and their highly integrative conception of science. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Our analytical perspective, grounded in a cultural-historical framework, involves scrutinizing how the different materials emerge and evolve as signifiers for something other than themselves during teacher-student and student-student transactions. This approach allows us to trace the emergence of students' interpretations of the relations between phenomena and their diverse presentations without committing to any preconceived notion of what these presentations stand for.

The most frequently evaluated components are prior knowledge and backgrounds, connection with reality, science as inquiry and level of initiative and group work. Overall, the results suggest a considerable diversity in the operationalisation of the components found. Particularly, for connection with reality, science as inquiry and level of initiative and group work, this is related to (1) the object of measurement (e.g. variety in aspects evaluated) and (2) the extent to which the used concepts are clarified. Consequently, some scales, items and questions were found to be a closer fit with aspects of project-based learning environments than others.

To achieve this, we analyzed data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment, which had science as its focus. Consistently, our findings show that science students who report experiencing low levels of inquiry-oriented learning activities are found to have above-average levels of science literacy, but below-average levels of interest in science, and below-average levels on six variables that reflect students' engagement in science. Our findings show that the corollary is also true. Across the three countries, students who report high levels of inquiry-oriented learning activities in science are observed to have below-average levels of science literacy, but above-average levels of interest in learning science, and above-average engagement in science. These findings appear to run counter to science education orthodoxy that the more students experience inquiry-oriented teaching and learning, the more likely they are to have stronger science literacy, as well as more positive affect toward science. We discuss the implications of these findings for science educators and researchers. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

A reflective engagement framework was developed, consisting of three dimensions: intellectual, personal and social reflective engagement. Participants involved 26 in-service teachers for a teacher professional development programme on e-Learning. Participants were encouraged to bring and use their own portable computing devices as a ""personalized learning hub"" to support their reflective engagement. The analysis of qualitative and quantitative data collected provides evidence on learners' attainment of reflective engagement in the three dimensions. The designed initiative enabled learners to achieve a significant knowledge gain for enhancing their understanding of e-Learning. The learners perceived that the initiative could help achieving their learning outcomes. They also perceived that group interaction and experience sharing with peers, teachers and related experts in this context could help advance their knowledge. These results imply that the designed initiative can promote learners to be engaged in reflective inquiry for deep learning and personal growth. Directions of future work are discussed regarding validating the developed framework through extending the use of the reflective engagement framework and the ""personalized learning hub"" initiative embedding BYOD to more learning scenarios, and enhancing the related teacher professional development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent research suggests that task segmentation can also promote children’s use of this strategy.

Children in the direct instruction condition (n = 22) were taught the CVS prior to investigating a multivariable inquiry task. Children in the task structuring condition (n = 23) were not, but received a segmented version of the inquiry task that addressed the variables in successive order. Children in the control condition (n = 22) investigated the multivariable inquiry task without additional support. Comparison among these three conditions revealed that task structuring equals direct instruction in effectiveness to promote children to use the CVS and draw valid inferences, and that either type of guidance is more effective than unguided inquiry learning.

We implemented five steps derived from the construct modeling approach to design MASIA. During the implementation, multiple sources of evidence were collected in the steps of pilot testing and Rasch modeling to support the validity of MASIA. Particularly, through the participation of 1,066 8th and 11th graders, MASIA showed satisfactory psychometric properties to discriminate students with different levels of inquiry abilities in 101 items in 29 tasks when Rasch models were applied. Additionally, the Wright map indicated that MASIA offered accurate information about students’ inquiry abilities because of the comparability of the distributions of student abilities and item difficulties. The analysis results also suggested that MASIA offered precise measures of inquiry abilities when the components (questioning, experimenting, analyzing, and explaining) were regarded as a coherent construct. Finally, the increased mean difficulty thresholds of item responses along with three performance levels across all sub-abilities supported the alignment between our scoring rubrics and our inquiry framework.

As they have unique and valuable perspectives on the role of technology in education, it is of utmost importance to engage them in a participatory design process. Adopting a case study methodology, we aim to reveal in what ways teachers work as participatory designers and define conditions that support teachers in that. Two initiatives of participatory design in Canada and Singapore were investigated. Design materials, transcripts of design meetings, and interviews with teachers were qualitatively analyzed. Case study 1 (Canada) showed that two teachers participating in software design for an astronomy curriculum contributed by suggesting new design features, introducing pedagogical requirements, and providing feedback on prototypes or design ideas. It appeared essential that teachers feel that their ideas were valued and respected in the entire process. In case study 2 (Singapore), six teachers contributed to the design of a mobile learning trail through: Theorizing and bridging knowledge building principles, collaborative prototyping, contextual inquiry of activity relevance and activity execution, and collaborative evaluation of technology integration. Teachers valued case study discussions with similar cultural contexts and visiting the learning site to design with contextual knowledge. From our case studies, it can be concluded that teachers contribute to the design processes by engaging in theoretical discussion, active participation in a design partnership, reflection about pedagogy and practice, and experimenting with enactment.

Three hundred thirty-two 7th-grade students were randomly assigned to either a reading or a generating condition and completed a web-based inquiry unit focusing on energy concepts in photosynthesis. When students interacted with a dynamic visualization of energy transformation, typical guidance provided text explanations while inquiry-oriented guidance asked students to generate their own explanations about three key energy transformation concepts. The results showed that both reading and generating explanations helped students interpret the visualization, but generating explanations was more beneficial. Students who generated explanations were better able to extract salient information and distinguish among multiple ideas. In particular, they made more connections between their understanding of energy transformation learned from the visualization to other energy concepts to articulate the process of photosynthesis than those who read instructional explanations. Analyses of log data revealed that students in each condition spent similar amounts of time learning from the visualization but navigated the activities in distinct ways and engaged in different kinds of collaborative discourse. This study builds on previous research showing the value of prompting students to generate explanations by clarifying the effective timing for such guidance and characterizing how it helps students make sense of visualizations. These results show that well-designed guidance enables students working in pairs to generate useful explanations for learning from visualizations and suggest promising designs for online instruction featuring dynamic visualizations. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Causes can be spatially separated from their effects by great distances. Action at a distance, the idea that causes and effects can be separated in physical space, is a well-studied concept in developmental psychology. However, the extant literature has focused largely on cases where causes and effects are separated in physical space but are contained within the same attentional space, for instance, how magnets on a table interact or how a lamp projected against an object creates a shadow despite the spatial gap between the lamp, object, and shadow. This paper considers the understanding of causes and effects that are separated both in physical and attentional space - a concept referred to here as ""action at an attentional distance."" Findings from an in-depth study of second, fourth and sixth graders' (n = 10) reasoning about action at an attentional distance are presented.

Educational funding and efforts have been invested to establish these cross-institutional collaborations in many countries. Since 2006, Taiwan initiated the High Scope Program, a high school science curriculum reform to promote scientific innovation and inquiry through an integration of advanced science and technology in high school science curricula through partnership between high school teachers and higher education scientists and science educators. This study, as part of this governmental effort, a scientist–teacher collaborative model (STCM) was constructed by 8 scientists and 4 teachers to drive an 18-week high school science curriculum reform on environmental education in a public high school. Partnerships between scientists and teachers offer opportunities to strengthen the elements of effective science teaching identified by Shulman and ultimately affect students’ learning. Mixed methods research was used for this study. Qualitative methods of interviews were used to understand the impact on the teachers’ and scientists’ science teaching. A quasi-experimental design was used to understand the impact on students’ scientific competency and scientific interest. The findings in this study suggest that the use of the STCM had a medium effect on students’ scientific competency and a large effect on students’ scientific individual and situational interests. In the interviews, the teachers indicated how the STCM allowed them to improve their content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and the scientists indicated an increased knowledge of learners, knowledge of curriculum, and PCK. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

We review research to clarify the impacts of dynamic visualisations and to identify instructional scaffolds that mediate their success. We use meta-analysis to synthesise 47 independent comparisons between dynamic and static materials and 76 comparisons that test the effect of specific instructional scaffolds. These studies show that dynamic visualisations are better than static visuals at promoting conceptual inferences about science, consistent with the success of inquiry instruction in science. To realise this potential of dynamic visualisations, instruction needs to help students use the dynamic visualisation to make sense of their own ideas. Scaffolds that are most successful include prompts for reflection, prompts to distinguish among parts of the visualisation, visual cues that identify salient features, multiple visualisations presented sequentially, and interactive features that govern the pacing of activities.

The framework comprised four pillars: science content knowledge, scientific inquiry, nature of science (NOS), and socioscientific issues (SSI). A conceptual understanding of these pillars as interconnected was presented and justified. Then the developed framework was used to examine the potential of the Qatari science standards to prepare environmentally literate citizens. Results showed that the secondary Qatari science standards generally take up the pillars of science content and scientific inquiry in an explicit manner. The NOS pillar is rarely addressed, while the SSI pillar is not addressed in the objectives and activities in a way that aligns with the heavy emphasis given in the overall aims. Moreover, the connections among pillars are mostly manifested within the activities and between the science content and scientific inquiry. The objectives and activities targeting the environment were less frequent among the four pillars across the Qatari standards. Again, the connections related to the environment were less frequent in conformity with the limited environmental objectives and activities. Implications from this study relate to the need for the distribution of the four pillars across the standards as well as the presentation of the different pillars as interconnected. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Most applications of narrative are extrinsic to science—such as when they are used for creating affect and context. Where they are intrinsic, they are often limited to special cases and uses. To extend the reach of narrative in science, a hypothesis of narrative framing of natural and technical scenes is formulated. The term narrative framing is used in a double sense, to represent (1) the enlisting of narrative intelligence in the perception of phenomena and (2) the telling of stories that contain conceptual elements used in the creation of scientific models of these phenomena. The concrete case for narrative framing is made by conceptual analyses of simple stories of natural phenomena and of products related to modern continuum thermodynamics that reveal particular figurative structures. Importantly, there is evidence for a medium-scale perceptual gestalt called force of nature that is structured metaphorically and narratively. The resulting figurative conceptual structure gives rise to the notion of natural agents acting and suffering in storyworlds. In order to show that formal scientific models are deeply related to these storyworlds, a link between using (i.e. simulating) models and storytelling is employed. This link has recently been postulated in studies of narrative in computational science and economics. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

This study focuses on the science education of preservice elementary teachers with the goal of improving their attitudes before they begin their professional lives as classroom teachers. Specifically, this study builds on a small body of research to examine whether exposure to inquiry-based science content courses that actively involve students in the collaborative process of learning and discovery can promote a positive change in attitudes toward science across several different dimensions. To examine this issue, surveys and administrative data were collected from over 200 students enrolled in the Hands on Science (HoS) program for preservice teachers at the University of Texas at Austin, as well as more than 200 students in a comparison group enrolled in traditional lecture-style classes. Quantitative analyses reveal that after participating in HoS courses, preservice teachers significantly increased their scores on scales measuring confidence, enjoyment, anxiety, and perceptions of relevance, while those in the comparison group experienced a decline in favorable attitudes to science. These patterns offer empirical support for the attitudinal benefits of inquiry-based instruction and have implications for the future learning opportunities available to students at all education levels. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

A quasi-experiment was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the structured argumentation scaffold in developing skill in constructing scientific explanations and engaging in electronic dialogues. A web-based collaborative synchronous inquiry system, ASIS (Argumentative Scientific Inquiry System), was utilized to support students as they worked in groups to carry out inquiry tasks. Two intact sixth grade classes (n = 50) participated in the study. The data show that the ASIS with the structured argumentation scaffold helped students significantly improve their skills in constructing scientific explanations, make more dialogue moves for explanation and query, and use more of all four argument components. In addition, the use of warrants, one of the components of an argument, was found to be a critical variable in predicting students' competence with regard to constructing scientific explanations.

However, there is still limited understanding about how students engage in social forms of regulation processes and what roles these regulatory processes may play during collaborative learning. The purpose of this study was to identify when and how co- and shared regulation of metacognitive, emotional and motivational processes emerge and function during collaborative inquiry learning in science. Two groups of three students (aged 12) from a private primary school in Turkey were videotaped during collaborative inquiry activities in a naturalistic classroom setting over a seven-week period, and the transcripts were analysed in order to identify their use of regulation processes. Moreover, this was combined with the analysis of stimulated-recall interviews with the student groups. Results indicated that co- and shared regulation processes were often initiated by particular events and played a crucial role in the success of students’ collaborative inquiry learning. Co-regulation of metacognitive processes had the function of stimulating students to reflect upon and clarify their thinking, as well as facilitating the construction of new scientific understanding. Shared regulation of metacognitive processes helped students to build a shared understanding of the task, clarify and justify their shared perspective, and sustain the ongoing knowledge co-construction. Moreover, the use of shared emotional and motivational regulation was identified as important for sustaining reciprocal interactions and creating a positive socio-emotional atmosphere within the groups. In addition, the findings revealed links between the positive quality of group interactions and the emergence of co- and shared regulation of metacognitive processes.

At the same time, the development of skills in the field of scientific inquiry constitutes a focal point of interest for science education. Against this background, the purpose of this study was to investigate to which extent multiple student characteristics contribute to skills of scientific inquiry. Based on a theoretical framework describing nine epistemological acts, we constructed and administered a multiple-choice test that assesses these skills in lower and upper secondary school level (n = 780). The test items contained problem-solving situations that occur during chemical investigations in school and had to be solved by choosing an appropriate inquiry procedure. We collected further data on 12 cognitive, motivational, and sociodemographic variables such as conceptual knowledge, enjoyment of chemistry, or language spoken at home. Plausible values were drawn to quantify students’ inquiry skills. The results show that students’ characteristics predict their inquiry skills to a large extent (55%), whereas 9 out of 12 variables contribute significantly on a multivariate level. The influence of sociodemographic traits such as gender or the social background becomes non-significant after controlling for cognitive and motivational variables. Furthermore, the performance advance of students from upper secondary school level can be explained by controlling for cognitive covariates. We discuss our findings with regard to curricular aspects and raise the question whether the inquiry skills can be considered as an autonomous trait in science education research. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

This situation means preservice teachers often see few connections between the research-based principles for teaching science they learn in university-based coursework and the science teaching practices they see in their classroom field placements. We attempted to resolve this situation by creating opportunities for preservice and mentor teachers to learn together. We developed colearning tasks where preservice and mentor teachers collaborated to apply principles of science inquiry and equitable learning to analyze and modify common elementary science curriculum materials. We borrowed from the field of ecology to develop an edge effects framework that enabled an analysis of when and how preservice and mentor teachers connected principle- and practical-based discourses while engaged in the colearning tasks. Our findings suggest that the colearning tasks supported preservice and mentor teachers in connecting research-based principles to practical classroom contexts. However, working on these tasks together was sometimes challenging for both preservice and mentor teachers. We discuss the affordances and constraints of the colearning tasks and the framing of the principle–practical divide as an edge rather than a gap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

However, methods to investigate situational interest in science teaching and learning are not broadly examined. This study compares the pupils’ observed situational interest and their expressed situational interest. One class of Finnish fourth-graders (N = 22, age 9–10 years) participated in a heat transfer lesson. The lesson encompassed an interactive demonstration with a thermal camera, teacher-led discussions and the conduct and presentation of a collaborative inquiry task. Pupils expressed their interest levels (scale: 1= very boring, 5= very interesting) by using an electronic response system called a ‘clicker’. The measurement took place 15 times during the lesson, with 1 measurement being just a rehearsal. The lesson was video recorded, and visible aspects of interest at the measurement time points were analysed. Reported and observational data were compared. In most cases, the observations did not yield data compatible with the pupils’ own evaluations, indicating that most pupils’ expressed interest is not easily interpreted through observation of their facial expressions and behaviour. In general, the interest of the group as a whole seems to diminish during the lesson. We argue that in order to maintain and increase pupils’ interest, their evaluations should be taken into account in lesson planning. Video-based research might also be further enriched and validated by employing the participants’ own expressions.

To realize this vision, all students will need opportunities to learn from high-quality curriculum materials where they engage in science practices. We report on our study of a middle school curriculum called Project-Based Inquiry Science that has some design features that match well with the new directions in science education. To measure the impact of these materials, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in sixth grade science classrooms across 42 schools in an urban school district. We randomly assigned schools to either a treatment condition where teachers implemented the project-based science curriculum or a comparison condition where teachers implemented the district-adopted textbook. Teachers in both conditions received professional development on the Framework. Students who participated in the project-based science curriculum outperformed students in the comparison curriculum on outcome measures that were aligned to core science ideas and science practices in the Framework. Importantly, the results show that project-based curriculum materials that incorporate science practices along with disciplinary content can help students achieve next generation science learning outcomes when there is coherence with district guidance about instruction. The study findings suggest that curriculum materials, district involvement, and support for teachers' implementation of new forms of instruction are important for realizing the vision and key principles of the Framework in the context of a large and diverse urban school district. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The author analyzed approximately 10 hours of classroom discourse from elementary science classrooms organized around inquiry-based science curricula and texts. Teacher questions and feedback were classified according to their dialogic orientation and contextually inferred structural purpose, while student understanding was operationalized as a dynamic interaction between cognitive process, syntacto-semantic complexity, and science knowledge type. The results of this study closely mirror Chin's and other scholars' findings that the fixed nature of authoritatively oriented questioning can dramatically limit students' opportunities to demonstrate higher order scientific understanding, while dialogically oriented questions, by contrast, often grant students the discursive space to demonstrate a greater breadth and depth of both canonical and self-generated knowledge. However, certain teacher questioning sequences occupying the ‘middle ground’ between maximal authoritativeness and dialogicity revealed patterns of meaningful, if isolated, instances of higher order thinking. Implications for classroom practice are discussed along with recommendations for future research. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

A total of 1,396 seventh- and eighth-grade students took the science test, including 313 ELL students. The results showed that, overall, non-ELLs significantly outperformed ELLs.

In addition, defining the causal dependencies among the variables is also not trivial. Such difficulty stemmed mainly because conceptual change is an implicit mental model restructuring process, which occurs as a result of confrontation with new knowledge; (ii) to model the process of conceptual change across time by merely observing student interactions could be misleading. This is largely because within the computer-based learning environment, students are granted the freedom to explore and evaluate their ideas. To ease these challenges, this study began with proposing variables of conceptual change and subsequently employing a Bayesian Network model to capture the causal dependencies between the proposed variables as well as the evolving patterns of conceptual change. To obtain the optimal model, two conceptual change Bayesian Network models were proposed and integrated into INQPRO before they can be empirically evaluated via a field study. In this study, interaction logs from 96 were collected and preprocessed before feeding into the proposed models. The accuracy of each Bayesian Network model was measured by matching the results of posttest and interview with the predicted conceptual change outcomes of each model. The empirical findings supported the notion that the conceptual change Bayesian Network model with self-regulation node is a better solution to predict a student's conceptual change in INQPRO. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Participation of students in scientific research raises the question of how to bridge the gap between an upper secondary school inquiry practice and a scientific research practice. To bridge this gap, a design based on 6 principles derived from an educational model of a community of learners was proposed. The study first aimed at revealing whether the proposed principles were necessary according to the students, their teacher and three pharmacochemistry researchers for successful participation of the students in the research community. Second, the study examined whether the students' understanding of discipline-specific content knowledge, interest in scientific research and knowledge about the nature of science changed during the course of the study. Data were obtained from questionnaires, interviews and video tapes. The results indicated that according to the teacher all 6 principles were necessary to bridge the gap, whereas according to the students 1 principle and according to the pharmacochemistry researchers 2 principles were necessary but difficult to achieve. Furthermore, all students gained discipline-specific content knowledge. Their interest in scientific research exhibited a positive change and their knowledge about the nature of science increased.

This study examines student understanding in inquiry peer reviews among pre-university chemistry students, aged 16-17, when they enact a design of a mimicked scholarly peer review. This design is based on a model of a human activity system. Twenty-five different schools in Brazil, Germany, Poland and The Netherlands participated. The students (n = 880) conducted in small groups (n = 428) open inquiries on fermentation. All groups prepared an inquiry report for peer review. These reports were published on a website. Groups were randomly paired in an internet symposium, where they posted review comments to their peers. These responses were qualitatively analyzed on small groups' level of understanding regarding seven categories: inquiry question, hypothesis, management of control variables, accurate measurement, presenting results, reliability of results, discussion and conclusion. The mimicked scholarly review prompted a collective practice. Student understanding was significantly well on presenting results, discussion and conclusion, and significantly less on inquiry question and reliability of results. An enacted design, based on a model of a human activity system, created student understanding of quality in inquiries as well as an insight in a peer-reviewing practice.

We took advantage of the advanced technology to develop a simulation-based assessment of inquiry abilities (SAIA) that allowed students to generate scientific explanations and demonstrate their experimental abilities. This paper describes the validation of the assessment. Data were collected from 48 12th-grade students at a local high school who were categorized into three groups based on their program majors. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were utilized to validate SAIA. The quantitative results showed that SAIA was aligned with a validated reasoning-skill test (criterion-related validity), discriminated variance among different groups (construct validity), and was highly suitable for examining inquiry abilities (content validity). Additionally, we utilized the think-aloud technique in order to identify the performances exhibited by students while they accomplished the SAIA tasks. The protocol analysis indicated that in general, students demonstrated the expected abilities in SAIA and that their SAIA scores accurately reflected their performance levels of inquiry abilities. The results suggested that SAIA was a valid assessment for evaluating the inquiry abilities of high school students.

We wanted to find out to what extent teachers implement inquiry activities in science teaching, the level of support they provide, and what type of inquiry they implement. Four questionnaires applied to 173 teachers resulted in the identification of high context beliefs and moderately high self-efficacy beliefs. Teachers declared to implement activities mostly to develop understanding of the material, as contrast to actual manipulation of data and/or coming to conclusions. They adopt rather a strictly guided approach in contrast to giving autonomy to learners to work on their own. Finally, teachers keep control with regard to question formulation and choice in solution procedures, which constrains the development of real inquiry. When comparing teacher beliefs, we found that teachers' context beliefs make a difference in the level of support that teachers provide to their students. Teachers with lower context beliefs ask students to perform inquiry activities on their own to a lesser extent when compared with teachers with higher context beliefs. This implies that further research on the implementation of inquiry in science teaching should take into account teachers' differences in their context beliefs. We also found out that the use of high or low support in inquiry activities remained the same for teachers with either higher or lower self-efficacy beliefs. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

A common obstacle to inquiry is that it strongly diverges from current classroom culture and hence, is outside the sphere of teachers' and students' experiences. Teachers and students bring expectations to the classroom that are entrenched in traditional practices and influenced by dynamics of power that exist within all teacher-student relationships. This study, which emerged during a wider study of the use of a Virtual Chemistry Lab in supporting IBSE, explores how classroom discourse constructs and maintains power relations that either stifle or facilitate inquiry-based approaches in two science lessons. Research methods included teacher interviews, student focus groups, video-recorded lessons, and student self-assessments. Findings indicate distinctive features of power inside the classroom that impact on inquiry-based instruction, such as predominant teacher monitoring on task completion over task understanding, lack of student engagement in ownership of scientific ideas, and prevailing norms of what effective teacher questioning is. We discuss implications for IBSE change efforts, highlighting that well-established power relations currently represent an important limiting factor in the capacity of teachers' IBSE implementation. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

The laboratory activities that the students participated in during the course were designed using the Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) an instructional model. This model gives a more central place to argumentation and the role of argument in the social construction of scientific knowledge. The development of the students' ability to construct a scientific argument and to participate in scientific argumentation was tracked over time using three different data sources. These data sources included a performance task, which was administered at the beginning, middle, and end of the course, video recording of the students participating in episodes of argumentation, and the lab reports the students wrote as part of each lab activity. As time was the independent variable in this study, a repeated measure ANOVA was used to evaluate changes in the ways students performed on each task over the course of the semester. The results of the analysis indicate that there was significant growth in the quality of the students' written arguments and nature of their oral argumentation. There also was a significant correlation between written and oral arguments.

The PD programme utilized regional summer workshops, district-based leadership teams and distance delivery technologies to help teachers learn science concepts and inquiry teaching strategies associated with a selection of popular science inquiry kits and how to adapt inquiry science lessons in the kits to teach and reinforce skills in the language arts-i.e. to teach more than science when doing inquiry science. Analyses of the school district-level pre-post high-stakes achievement scores of 33 school districts participating in the adaptation of inquiry PD and a comparative group of 23 school districts revealed that both the Grade 3 and Grade 6 student-cohorts in the school districts utilizing adapted science inquiry lessons significantly outscored their student-cohort counterparts in the comparative school districts. The positive school district-level high-stakes test results, which serve as the basis for state and local decision making, suggest that an inquiry adaptation strategy and a combination of regional live workshop and distance delivery technologies with ongoing local leadership and support can serve as a viable PD option for K-6 science. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Qualitative methods were employed to identify the most salient types and sequences of discursive modes and to interpret their pedagogical functions in the context of MBI. Results indicated that exploring was one of the most frequently used discursive modes in the MBI classrooms. Sometimes two different types of exploring discourse were connected sequentially so that the pattern of exploring (scientific phenomena)-exploring (student ideas) appeared. The discursive sequences of exploring-retrieving and exploring-negotiating also emerged whereby the teacher guided students to align their models with the canonical knowledge of science. The teacher also helped students in modelling using elaborating and reformulating discourse modes as well as metadiscourse.

Second year pre-service teachers (N = 98) were instructed to carry out an inquiry using a selection of suitable applications to support their work in a forest ecology field course. Although they were not specifically instructed on the use of the software applications, the assumption was that being 'digital natives' they would be familiar with them or would readily adopt them. The study reports the students' experiences of the course. Results show variations in their experiences: differences in the way they saw the adequacy of their ICT skills, the suitability of the software, and in their opinions about familiarizing themselves with the software applications as part of the inquiry process. The results also indicate that in future it is important to: (i) concretize and explain the pedagogical aspects of using social software applications as part of the learning process; (ii) highlight the reasons why software applications are used for supporting learning, i.e., the added value; and (iii) encourage students to explore and make use of different software applications for different learning purposes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants included 26 preservice science teachers enrolled in a 2-year Master of Teaching program. A specific program goal was to prepare teachers to use technology to support reform-based science instruction. To this end, the program integrated technology instruction across five courses and situated this instruction within the context of learning and teaching science. A variety of data sources were used to characterize the participants' intentions and instructional practices, including classroom observations, lesson plans, interviews, and written reflections. Data analysis followed a constant comparative process with the goal of describing if, how, and why the participants integrated technology into their instruction and the extent to which they applied, adapted, and innovated upon what they learned in the science teacher preparation program. Results indicate that all participants used technology throughout their student teaching for reform-based science instruction. Additionally, they used digital images, videos, animations, and simulations to teach process skills, support inquiry instruction, and to enhance student engagement in ways that represented application, adaptation, and innovation upon what they learned in the science teaching methods program. Participants cited several features of the science teacher preparation program that helped them to effectively integrate technology into their instruction. These included participating in science lessons in which technology was modeled in the context of specific instructional approaches, collaborating with peers, and opportunities for feedback and reflection after teaching lessons. The findings of this study suggest that situated learning theory may provide an effective structure for preparing preservice teachers to integrate technology in ways that support reform-based instruction. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

It investigates assessment scales developed from a novel theoretical rationale, describing scientific reasoning as three fundamental practices (hypothesizing, experimenting, and evidence evaluation) and building on three types of knowledge (science content knowledge, procedural knowledge, and epistemic knowledge). The scale development follows a construct-driven approach by, first, detailing the knowledge involved and explaining progression; and second, operationalizing the theoretical construct into items and score criteria. The scales are trialled in a small-scale study. The outcome is a coherent and supportive validity argument for two sub-scales, but with a suggestion that merging these into one scale has higher validity. The main implication is rewriting rationales for many science assessments, including TIMSS, which emphasises domain-general reasoning, and NAEP and PISA, which pay attention to domain-specific reasoning but are unclear about the knowledge involved.

To better reflect the ways of thinking required for learning about systems, we developed and implemented a pedagogical approach using box-and-arrow models (similar to concept maps) as a foundational tool for instruction and assessment in an Introductory Biology course on genetics, evolution, and ecology. Over the course of one semester, students iteratively constructed, evaluated, and revised ""Gene-to-Evolution"" (GtE) models intended to promote understanding about the connections linking molecular-level processes with population-level outcomes. In practice, a successful GtE model contextualizes information provided in a case study and explains how genetic-level variation originates at the molecular level, is differentially expressed among individuals, and is acted upon by the environment to produce evolutionary change within a population. Our analyses revealed that students' ability to construct biologically accurate models increased throughout the semester. Model complexity peaked near mid-term then subsequently declined. This suggests that, with time, students were building more parsimonious models, shedding irrelevant information, and improving in their ability to apply accurate and appropriate biological language to explain relationships among concepts. Importantly, we observed the greatest relative gains in model correctness among students who entered the course with lower mean GPA. In an analysis comparing performance among achievement tritiles, lower-performing students effectively closed the achievement gap with the highest performing students by the end of the semester. Our findings support the effectiveness of model-based pedagogies for science teaching and learning, and offer a perspective on pedagogical application of modeling strategies to foster systems thinking and knowledge structuring in college-level biology.

Results showed that children are naturally inclined to pose single-variable inquiry questions. Segmented tasks, in addition, invoked more systematic but equally comprehensive investigations than a single, unsegmented task. More systematic experimentation was associated with more valid inferences and beliefs.

The first part, a quantitative test (N = 96), tested students' competences in designing an experiment. It was found that students need scaffolding in basic aspects of designing (like dependent and independent variables), to reach higher levels, since only about thirty percent reach levels II or III out of three levels. On more reflective aspects (like confounding variables, test times and repetitions), only a maximum of twenty-five percent reached level I or higher; therefore, even more support is needed on these aspects.

Our research addresses this gap by examining how strategies cultivated in a yearlong chemistry curriculum (the originating context) appeared (absent teacher intervention) in a new context with new peers. Dependent upon Lobato's actor-oriented transfer perspective (2006), this mixed-methods study deploys a multilevel analysis of video data collected in six physics classrooms (the new context) during a researcher-designed activity. Results show that absent teacher directives, two classes partially attempted to frame the physics inquiry using strategies cultivated in the original context, and one fully framed the new context using these strategies. This class's successful use of a specific focusing phenomenon (electing student managers) appeared as the key component in this full framing.

Nevertheless, a review of the literature indicates a few cases of elementary teachers who do well in science and offers rare examples of enthusiast elementary teachers. The question then becomes how those cases came to be? The purpose of this study is to document two such cases of prospective elementary teachers, illustrate their unique characteristics and shed light on how those came to be. The study was designed upon a narrative inquiry approach focusing on the collection of personal stories. Multiple sources of data were used in order to examine the participants' science teaching orientations and the kinds of experiences that influenced their development: drawings, interviews, reflective assignments, and others. The analysis of the data was grounded within the Three-Dimensional Space Narrative Structure. The findings of the analysis illustrated that the participants perceived certain experiences they had during their university coursework as critical to shaping their orientations to science and science teaching: inquiry-based investigations, contemporary theoretical discussions, outdoors field study, friendly classroom environment and the characteristics of their instructors. These findings have implications for the design of teacher education courses that aim to engage prospective elementary teachers, especially females, in meaningful learning experiences and support them in developing science teaching orientations that are in line with reform recommendations. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Elementary school children were engaged in two scientific experiments in a marine biology research laboratory. A total of 136 students answered a questionnaire about their previous habits towards science and carried out the following actions: (1) a guided visit to the laboratory, (2) a brief presentation of the research theme, (3) the development of two experiments, and (4) a questionnaire about the experiments and science conceptions. The research methods included observation, document analysis, and content analysis of the answers to the questionnaires. Additionally, each visit was video recorded in order to design learning materials. The results revealed that most of the pupils were able to follow every stage of experimentation. However, some of them misinterpreted results and conclusions. One implication of the study is that this type of outdoor activity is extremely important to promote meaningful science learning in children, but more care should be taken in practical science activities so that children can overcome some common difficulties when performing scientific inquiry. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Overall, teachers' attitudes and conceptions toward the science subject domain and science education influence their ways of teaching and engagement. However, there is a lack of research regarding factors that affect this engagement in pre-school years. The main assumption of this study is that teachers' attitudes regarding science in pre-school can shape children's engagement in science and develop their scientific curiosity. Therefore, the main objectives of this study are to investigate the attitudes of pre-school teachers toward engaging in science and to explore their views about the nature of curiosity: who is a curious child and how can a child's natural curiosity be fostered? An extensive survey was conducted among 146 pre-school teachers by employing both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Results indicate that most of the participants believe that scientific education should begin in early childhood; very young children can investigate and take part in a process of inquiry; and scientific activities in pre-school can influence children's long-term attitudes toward science. Despite these views, most participants felt they did not possess sufficient scientific knowledge. Furthermore, participants expressed diverse opinions when asked to identify what constitutes curiosity, how the curious child can be identified and how a child's curiosity can be fostered. The research findings carry significant implications regarding how to implement scientific activities in pre-school, and how to encourage pre-school teachers to engage children in scientific activities in a way that will nurture their natural curiosity. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

However, the formulation of operational research questions of the sort used in authentic scientific inquiry is not a trivial task. Here, we set out to explore the possible influence of separating the research question from the laboratory techniques used to try and answer this question on teachers' understanding of laboratory techniques and their ability to formulate research questions. We conducted a laboratory course in microbiology in which the laboratory techniques were presented in an explicit and generalized manner, in the context of specific research questions. During the course, teachers' understanding of laboratory techniques improved as reflected in their answers to exercises given throughout. In addition, teachers' ability to ask research questions, analyzed using Dillon's classification of research questions, also improved. When reflecting upon the course, some teachers attributed the change in their ability to ask research questions to their increased knowledge of techniques, whereas others did not. We conclude that to facilitate research-question-asking skills among teachers, they should be provided with knowledge of the relevant laboratory techniques in an explicit fashion. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

In this paper, we present a framework that aims to integrate three perspectives to explain how and why representational construction supports learning in science. The first or semiotic perspective focuses on student use of particular features of symbolic and material tools to make meanings in science. The second or epistemic perspective focuses on how this representational construction relates to the broader picture of knowledge-building practices of inquiry in this disciplinary field, and the third or epistemological perspective focuses on how and what students can know through engaging in the challenge of representing causal accounts through these semiotic tools. We argue that each perspective entails productive constraints on students' meaning-making as they construct and interpret their own representations. Our framework seeks to take into account the interplay of diverse cultural and cognitive resources students use in these meaning-making processes. We outline the basis for this framework before illustrating its explanatory value through a sequence of lessons on the topic of evaporation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

The study was prompted by the results of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) 2008 survey of Irish primary science which indicated that a 72% of surveyed teachers are using science textbooks within their teaching. The reliance on deductive methodologies, such as the using textbooks, has been attributed to a lack of pedagogical content knowledge. As the Irish primary science curriculum was changed to be more experiential in 2003, it is unlikely that deductive teaching from textbooks aligns with the new aims and objectives of the curriculum. This research analyses three textbook groups through the lens of the 5E model of teaching, a well-known framework for teaching through inquiry. A four-layer framework was developed around the 5E model that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of textbooks in supporting IBSE. The results indicate that the various textbooks contain different structures, pedagogies and content, which can potentially be used to support the development of IBSE schema however, professional development must be provided as to how best to integrate textbooks into practice. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Project teachers participated in an intensive, week-long, resident institute where they learned about geology, evolutionary concepts, NOS, and inquiry while engaging in an authentic scientific investigation. They were also given support in how to teach these topics using an inquiry-based approach. Analyses of data indicate that project teachers showed greater gains in subject matter than comparison teachers and the relative change was significantly different statistically. Furthermore, most project teachers demonstrated a shift from less informed to more informed views of inquiry and NOS and the relative change between participant and comparison teachers was significantly different statistically. These gains are promising because they suggest that short-term and intensive PD can support teachers in enhancing their knowledge and views. Moreover, analysis of post-programme questionnaires and interviews indicated that supporting teachers in reflecting on the relationship between their former classroom teaching practice, and new knowledge acquired during PD, may be an important link in enhancing teacher knowledge and supporting change in practice. This suggests that enhanced knowledge and views may not be the only factor contributing to changing one's practice. The study points to the importance of reflection in promoting teacher change.

Toward this end, we unite two theoretical perspectives to advance a conceptualization of culture as a complex system, emerging from iterative processes of cultural bricolage, that is, a cyclic (re)application, and adaptation via approximation, of cultural tools to contexts as they uniquely arise. This conception of culture provides a means for transmission of culture from one individual to another, but it also allows for substantial diversity of individual perspectives within a cultural group in ways that supra-individual conceptions of culture do not. What is more, this diversity of individuals provides a mechanism for cultural evolution and simultaneously allows for an individual to be shaped by culture and culture to be shaped by the individual. Culture, in this conception, is understood to be an emergent phenomenon, built up from iterative application of cultural software.

The study shows how the students only are left with 'how-to' skills before they engage in collaborative processing supported by their own picture from the experiment. The picture becomes a hub for interactive sensemaking and is extensively used for annotation and discussion.

However, evidence from the 2011 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Exam assessment suggests fourth-grade students (9-10 year-olds) in the USA perform higher than those in Germany, despite more instructional time devoted to elementary science in Germany. The purpose of this study is to comparatively analyze fourth-grade classroom science in both countries to learn more about how teachers and students engage in scientific inquiry, particularly explanation-construction. Videorecordings of US and German science instruction (n 1= 42, n 2= 42) were sampled from existing datasets and analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Despite German science lessons being, on average, twice as long as those in the USA, study findings highlight many similarities between elementary science in terms of scientific practices and features of scientific inquiry. However, they also illustrate crucial differences around the scientific practice of explanation-construction. While students in German classrooms were afforded more substantial opportunities to formulate evidence-based explanations, US classrooms were more strongly characterized by opportunities for students to actively compare and evaluate evidence-based explanations.

Classroom observation focused on the teacher and student verbal behavior, teachers' competency of instructional organization, their presentation of instructional content, and the organization of learning activities. Findings revealed that students were provided with limited opportunities for participating and engaging in learning as science teachers were dominant in classroom talk. Teachers emphasized on the integration of knowledge within one subject (within-subject knowledge), but not the integration of knowledge between subjects (cross-subject knowledge), resulting in the unsuccessful instruction of the integrative content. What is more, teachers were inadequately competent in designing and delivering science, technology and society content, scientific inquiry and scientific experiments, which also affected the quality of instruction on integrated science. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

We have therefore designed a mobile learning application 'ThinknLearn', which assists high school students in generating hypotheses during abductive inquiry investigations. The M3 evaluation framework was used to investigate the effectiveness of using 'ThinknLearn' to facilitate student learning. The results indicated in this paper showed improvements in the experimental group's learning performance as compared to a control group in pre-post tests.

Results show very low satisfaction. Identified reasons include the fact that the curriculum did not reflect the intended integration objectives of the major, and that the quality of science educators was inadequate to teach integrated courses. The most unsatisfactory aspects relate to the treatment of the nature of science, the integration of subject matters, and students' experience of inquiry learning in terms of both curriculum content and teaching methods. In addition to establishing an effective evaluation system, a more fundamental suggestion is to change the current normal college-based Chinese teacher education system especially in the science education sector. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Guided by this approach to the study of teacher thinking, the central goal of this exploratory study was to identify what prospective science teachers notice when evaluating evidence of student understanding in another teacher's inquiry-based unit. Our results are based on the qualitative analysis of 43 prospective teachers' evaluations of assessment evidence presented to them in the form of a video case and associated written artifacts. Analysis of our data revealed two major categories of elements, Task-General and Task-Specific, noticed by our study participants. Task-General elements included attention to learning objectives, independent student work, and presentation issues and they often served to guide or qualify the specific inquiry skills that were evaluated. Task-Specific elements included the noticing of students' abilities to perform different components of an investigation. In general, study participants paid attention to important general and specific aspects of student work in the context of inquiry. However, they showed preferential attention to those process skills associated with designing an investigation versus those practices related to the analysis of data and generation of conclusions. Additionally, their interpretations of assessment outcomes were largely focused on the demonstration of general science process skills; much less attention was paid to the analysis of the epistemological validity or scientific plausibility of students' ideas.

Modelling, as a pedagogical tool, involves the model construction, the exploration of model characteristics and the model application to a specific problem, resembling authentic activities of scientists and mathematicians (Herbert, 2003). Recent developments in strategy instruction research suggest that learning in a particular discipline is enhanced by guiding students through the development of content-relevant metacognitive strategies (Wosnitza & Volet, 2009). Problem-solving is a complex process, which involves several cognitive operations such as collecting and selecting information, heuristic strategy and metacognition (De Corte, 2003; Garofalo & Lester, 1985; Schoenfeld, 1994). The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the Computational Experiment Methodology on learners' cognitive performance, use of modelling indicators and shift of the metacognitive experiences during problem solving using computational models. Sixty prospective primary school teachers volunteered to participate in the study. Students were exposed by the Instructor to a number of computational experiments, while during the course they developed their own models of simulation. The results of the experiment show that the use of the computational experiment approach has a substantial effect on the metacognitive experiences and the use of modelling indicators. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants totaled 198: 33 in the summer section, 87 in the fall experimental (clickers) group, and 78 in the fall (paddles) comparison group. Because metacognition is associated with higher academic outcomes, we hypothesized that the response device which elicited higher levels of metacognition would also demonstrate higher performance outcomes. While results from the study indicate that metacognitive processes are influenced more so by paddles than by clickers, clicker use produced significantly higher performance outcomes.

Understandings derived from the history of technological development in other domains (e.g. medicine, transportation, and warfare) reveal numerous parallels that help to explain these recurrent patterns. Historical analyses of major technologies reveal a conglomerate of factors that interact to produce benefits, as well as intended and unintended consequences. On a macro-scale, PoT facilitates understandings of how technologies interact and are impacted by individuals, society, institutions, economy, politics, and culture. At the micro-level, and most relevant to science education, PoT engages the inherent nature of technology along a number of key dimensions: role of culture and values, notions of technological progression, technology as part of systems, technological diffusion, technology as a fix, and the notions of expertise. Overall, the present analysis has implications for the design, development, implementation, and adoption of technological tools for use in precollege science education, and highlights the role of technology as both artifact and process. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

A secondary aim was to identify similarities and differences in the Community of Inquiry model among selected health care disciplines comparing sample student populations in previously described research. Results indicate that the instrument was validated in the health care disciplines on all subscales. Significant differences were found in social presence and cognitive presence among the three groups of students with no significant differences in teaching presence. There was a significant difference in presence by course experience (number of courses completed) for the second versus the fifth course in the social presence construct.

In the current study, we examined the comparative effectiveness of assessment tasks and test items presented in online modules that used either a static, active, or interactive modality. A total of 1,836 students from the classrooms of 22 middle school science teachers in 12 states participated in the study as part of normal classroom activities. Students took assessments in the three different modalities on three consecutive days. The assessments tested key concepts about ecosystems and students' ability to use inquiry skills in an ecosystems context. Our in-depth analyses focused on how the different modalities elicited specific content knowledge of ecosystems (e.g., producers, consumers, predator-prey relationships) and specific inquiry skills (e.g., designing and interpreting experiments). We also investigated student use of technology supports, such as replaying animations or inspecting graphs. The results showed that the interactive modality enabled the testing of more complex reasoning and that additional experience working in the online environment improved student performance for all the modalities, especially for the interactive modality. Each of the three modalities provided useful information about students' understanding of ecosystems and related inquiry skills as well as their misconceptions.

Both the SBL and the MBL used computers to collect, graph, and analyze data. A major difference was that the MBL allowed the students to manipulate physical materials, whereas in the SBL activity they manipulated virtual materials. In this quasi-experimental design, two 11th-grade classes (N = 68) at an urban public high school in Taipei were assigned to the SBL and MBL settings. The participants conducted the Boyle's law experiment without having done any relevant prior experiment. Their science concepts, performance of inquiry tasks, and attitudes toward the SBL/MBL were examined by pre- and postconceptual tests, an inquiry-based lab manual, and postlaboratory interviews. The results showed that both groups performed equally well and had remarkable gains in their pre- to posttest learning achievement. Nevertheless, physical manipulation may have contributed to inquiry practices such as creating practical ideas for conducting and improving the experiment and interpreting the data and may have increased the enjoyment of the laboratory. This study concludes that virtual manipulation is as effective as physical manipulation in learning physics concepts, but that the former gives learners some naïve expectations and induces certain learning strategies that seem to lead to mindless planning and conducting of experiments and hinders them from generating ideas to improve experiments. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

In this multicase study of beginning physics teachers in Australia, we were interested in the extent to which their expectations were realized and how their classroom experiences while implementing extended experimental investigations (EEIs) produced emotional states that mediated their teaching practices. Against rhetoric of fear expressed by their senior colleagues, three of the four teachers were surprised by the positive outcomes from their supervision of EEIs for the first time. Two of these teachers experienced high intensity positive emotions in response to their students' success. When student actions/outcomes did not meet their teachers' expectations, frustration, anger, and disappointment were experienced by the teachers, as predicted by a sociological theory of human emotions (Turner, J. H. (2007). Human emotions: A sociological theory. London, England: Routledge). Over the course of the EEI projects, the teachers' practices changed along with their emotional states and their students' achievements.

We argue that in order to understand the extent to which primary student teachers are able to embrace science teaching informed by scientific literacy for all, it is important to take into account various, sometimes competing, science teacher and primary teacher Discourses. The aim of this paper is to explore how such Discourses are constituted in the context of learning to teach during a 1-year university-based Post Graduate Certificate of Education course. The empirical data consist of semi-structured interviews with 11 student teachers. The analysis identifies 5 teacher Discourses and we argue that these can help us to better understand some of the tensions involved in becoming a primary teacher with a responsibility for teaching science: for example, in terms of the interplay between the student teachers' own educational biographies and institutionally sanctioned Discourses. One conclusion is that student teachers' willingness and ability to embrace a Discourse of science education, informed by the aim of scientific literacy for all, may be every bit as constrained by their experience of learning science through 'traditional schooling' as it is by their confidence with respect to their own subject knowledge. The 5 Discourses, with their complex interrelations, raise questions about which identity positions are available to students in the intersections of the Discourses and which identity positions teacher educators may seek to make available for their students. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Researchers and teachers consider it to be stimulating for pupils' application of research skills, construction of meaning and acquiring scientific knowledge. However, there is ambiguity as to what competencies are required to teach inquiry-based science. Our purpose is to develop a profile of professional competence, required for effective inquiry-based science teaching in primary schools in the Netherlands. This article reviews literature and compares the outcomes to the American National Science Education Standards (NSES). In so doing, it seeks to answer the following research questions: What elements of competencies required by primary school teachers who teach inquiry-based science are mentioned, discussed and researched in recent literature? To what extent are the American NSES (introduced 15 years ago) consistent with elements of competencies found in recent literature? A comprehensive literature review was conducted using Educational Resources Information Centre and Google Scholar databases. Fifty-seven peer-reviewed scientific journal articles from 2004 to 2011 were found using keyword combinations. Analysis of these articles resulted in the identification and classification of 22 elements of competencies. This outcome was compared to the American NSES, revealing gaps in the standards with respect to a lack of focus on how teachers view science teaching and themselves as teachers. We also found that elements of competencies are connected and poor mastery of one may affect a teacher's mastery of another. Therefore, we propose that standards for the Netherlands should be presented in a non-linear, holistic, competence-based model. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Review","Scopus"

However, little is known about how students view themselves as learners of science. In this paper, we explore primary children's images of doing science in school and how they compare themselves with 'real' scientists. Data were collected through the use of a questionnaire, drawing activity, and interviews from 161 Grade 4 (ages 9-10) students in Singapore. Results indicate that 'doing science as conducting hands-on investigations', 'doing science as learning from the teacher', 'doing science as completing the workbook', and 'doing science as a social process' are the images of learning science in school that most of the students held. In addition, students reported that they need to be well behaved first and foremost, while scientists are more likely to work alone and do things that are dangerous. Moreover, students often viewed themselves as 'acting like a scientist' in class, especially when they were doing experiments. Nevertheless, some students reported that they were unlike a scientist because they believed that scientists work alone with dangerous experiments and do not need to listen to the teacher and complete the workbook. These research findings further confirm the earlier argument that young children can make distinctions between school science and 'real' science. This study suggests that the teaching of science as inquiry and by inquiry will shape how students view their classroom experiences and their attitudes towards science. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Instead, they often confuse or mislead students. To clarify the impact of molecular visualizations for middle school students we explored three design variations implemented in a Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE) unit on thermodynamics: Observation, Research Guidance, or Critique. We tested these variations in an inquiry unit designed following the knowledge integration framework to promote coherent understanding. Seven middle school classes (205 students) and their two teachers participated in the study. Students studying each version of the unit made significant gains on knowledge integration items designed to measure coherent understanding of thermodynamics. Compared to Research Guidance, the Critique condition was more successful, especially in helping students conduct consequential experiments. Embedded assessments revealed that students who critiqued a confounded experiment were more successful in conducting valid experiments than students who did not critique. In addition, the combination of critique and virtual experimentation increased student ability to connect molecular and observable phenomena. These results suggest design guidelines to help future designers. Specifically, preceding experimentation with critique activities helps students distinguish among existing and new ideas. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Recently, concept-mapping (CM) was suggested as an adequate instrument for analysing students' system thinking. However, there are different ways with which to use this method. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine whether particular features of CM practices affect the valid assessment of students' system thinking. The particular features analysed were the medium (computer versus paper-pencil) and the directedness (highly directed versus nondirected) of CM practices. These features were evaluated with respect to their influence on (a) students' performance in CM and (b) the validity of different CM practices for system thinking. One hundred fifty-four German fourth graders (mean age: 9.95 years) and 93 eighth graders (mean age: 14.07 years) participated in the study following an experimental pre-test-post-test design. Three variations of CM practices were applied: (a) highly directed computer mapping, (b) highly directed paper-pencil mapping, and (c) nondirected paper-pencil mapping. In addition to the CM task, a paper-pencil questionnaire was employed to investigate the validity of the CM practices. Results showed that the computer positively influenced student performance in CM when compared with paper-pencil. By contrast, there was no difference between highly directed and nondirected mapping. Whereas the medium rarely influenced the validity of CM for system thinking, high directedness showed a positive influence. Considering the limitations and benefits of particular CM practices, we suggest highly directed and computer-based CM as an appropriate assessment tool-in particular, with regard to large-scale assessments of system thinking. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

It was found that a kindergarten teacher's discussion was mostly unhedged and boosted (absolutely), with the use of hedges (may, might, could) limited to an unexpected encounter with an undeveloped egg toward the end of the lesson. In contrast, a fourth-grade teacher's discussion was predominantly hedged, with the use of boosters limited to isolated episodes concerning the nature of scientific inquiry and experimental variables. Unhedged and boosted communication led to the co-construction of an unproblematic or factual body of scientific knowledge (transitivity, circumstantial, and nominal meanings), whereas hedged communication produced a problematic or tentative body of scientific knowledge (logical and taxonomic meanings). It is emphasized that unproblematic knowledge communication may be paralleled by NOS miscommunication.

We hypothesize that the CoI model's theoretical constructs of presence reflect educational effectiveness in a variety of environments.; that online learner self-regulation, a construct that we label ""learning presence"" moderates relationships of the other components within the CoI model. Consistent with previous research (e.g.; Means, Toyama, Murphy, Bakia, & Jones, 2009; Shea & Bidjerano, 2011) we found evidence that students in online and blended courses rank the modalities differently with regard to quality of teaching, social.; cognitive presence. Differences in help seeking behavior, an important component of self-regulated learning, were found as well. In addition, results suggest teaching presence and social presence have a differential effect on cognitive presence, depending upon learner's online self-regulatory cognitions and behaviors, i.e. their learning presence. These results also suggest a compensation effect in which greater self-regulation is required to attain cognitive presence in the absence of sufficient teaching and social presence.

We thus developed and implemented a science learning environment for children in the first years of schooling which contains structured learning materials with the goal of supporting conceptual change concerning the understanding of the floating and sinking of objects and fostering students' scientific reasoning skills. In the present implementation study, we aim to provide a best-practice example of early science learning. The study was conducted with a sample of 15 classes of the first years of schooling and a total of 244 children. Tests were constructed to measure children's conceptual understanding before and after the implementation. Our results reveal a decrease in children's misconceptions from pretest to posttest.

However, some theories involve theoretical entities (e.g., ""Weiss domains"") that cannot be observed directly and therefore may be hard to discover. Presenting theoretical ideas before or after inquiry activities might help to overcome these difficulties. However, whereas prior presentation of theoretical ideas enables learners to apply these ideas during inquiry activities and may therefore have a sustainable effect on knowledge on the theory level, subsequent presentation of theoretical ideas does not allow for applying these ideas during inquiry activities and may therefore fail to yield a lasting effect on knowledge on the theory level. In contrast, specific scaffolds designed to guide learners during their inquiry activities to foster knowledge on the level of phenomena may be ineffective with respect to knowledge on the theory level. A 2 × 2 × 2-factorial experiment with the factors specificity of scaffolds (unspecific/specific), prior presentation of theoretical ideas (no/yes), and subsequent presentation of theoretical ideas (no/yes) was conducted in an inquiry unit about magnetism. The sample analyzed comprised 538 pupils from 23 seventh-grade classes. In an immediate and a delayed posttest 2 months later, both knowledge on the level of phenomena and knowledge on the theory level were measured. Prior presentation of theoretical ideas had an immediate as well as a longer-term effect on knowledge on the theory level, whereas subsequent presentation of theoretical ideas only had a short-term effect. Specific scaffolds had no effect on any of the outcome variables. These findings suggest that learners may in fact derive predictions and explanations of the outcomes of their experiments if theoretical ideas are presented beforehand, and thereby develop deeper theoretical understanding. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To better support the practical integration of more student-directed inquiry into the science classroom, we consider one teacher's day-to-day praxis within the context of a yearlong chemistry curriculum. Using cultural historical activity theory (CHAT) we analyze how the interplay of key classroom elements (i.e., the classroom community, subjects, division of labor, mediating artifacts, rules, objects, and outcomes) varies within and across three distinct participant structures, and thus shapes what students experience as science. We construct CHAT activity models of each of the participant structures in order to examine how the teacher's differentiated use of traditional classroom mechanisms (e.g., whole class discussions and critique) scaffolds students' developing ability to direct their own inquiries. Our study demonstrates how a teacher can link elements within and between a diverse set of participant structures in ways that systematically create real opportunities for student-directed inquiry and collaboration while assuring students learn to act with disciplinary authority. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Given the time limitations of college methods courses, it is difficult to touch on more than a fraction of the science topics potentially taught across grades K-8, particularly in the context of relevant pedagogies. This research and development work centers on constructing a formative assessment resource to help expose pre-service teachers to a greater number of science topics within teaching episodes using various modes of instruction.

Each item contains a classroom vignette followed by response choices carefully crafted to include four basic pedagogies (didactic direct, active direct, guided inquiry, and open inquiry). The brief but numerous items allow a substantial increase in the number of science topics that pre-service students may consider. The intention is that students and teachers will be able to share and discuss particular responses to individual items, or else record their responses to collections of items and thereby create a snapshot profile of their teaching orientations. Subsets of items were piloted with students in pre-service science methods courses, and the quantitative results of student responses were spread sufficiently to suggest that the items can be effective for their intended purpose. © 2014 © 2014 The Author(s).

In this paper, we present a study of one such innovation which has been developed through a design-based research process in a Singapore school. The innovation features a primary science curriculum integrating the 5E inquiry phases with the use of mobile technology. It has evolved through the various development phases to where the innovation is becoming an integral part of routine classroom practices. With the objective of examining the impact of the curriculum innovation on science teaching and learning, this paper reports some of the results of our scaling efforts, in particular, those relating to changes in classroom practices and the effectiveness brought by the curriculum innovation. Using qualitative data analysis methods, the study discusses the transformation of the classroom practices on teachers' pedagogical approaches, classroom culture, lesson plan design, linkages to informal learning, assessment methods, and parent involvement. Quantitative analysis of the performance of students in science assessments when compared between pre-scaling and scaling phases shows the efficacy of the innovation when scaled up to a whole grade level. Implications are drawn to inform future studies or work on factors for effective scaling up of technology-supported curricular innovations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our specific research questions were (1) What ideas do elementary preservice teachers bring to a science teaching methods course about the inquiry continuum? and (2) How do their ideas about the inquiry continuum change over the course of the semester through engaging in planning, enactment, and reflection upon science instruction? Participants' course artifacts (journals, reflective teaching assignments, and lesson plan rationales), interviews, and field observations of their enacted science lessons served as data for this study. Findings show that although the preservice teachers began the semester defining inquiry as highly student-directed, their ideas and definitions broadened over the course of the semester to include and embrace more teacher-directed forms of inquiry. Their early science lessons were more student-directed but, as they encountered challenges engaging in inquiry-based instruction and increasingly emphasized students' learning needs, they began to plan and enact lessons that were more teacher-directed. Teacher education programs need to explicitly emphasize these variations of inquiry as a core component of supporting preservice teachers' learning to teach science as inquiry. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

In order to develop students' scientific inquiry, researchers and educators have developed different curricula and a variety of instructional resources, which make features and descriptors of scientific inquiry in teaching and learning even more diverse and complex. For revealing how the multi-facets of scientific inquiry are inherently correlated, this study identified descriptors representing features of scientific inquiry and automatically reviewed the research abstracts where these descriptors were used. A cluster analysis was used to analyze 171 relevant article abstracts published in Web of Science from 1986 to 2010, by using the data mining software WordStat v6.1. Networks of descriptors and of research strands showed the inter-relationships among descriptors and the research strands. Through triangulating the categorization results from automatic data-mining and expert researchers' qualitative reviewing, this study identified seven clusters of high-frequency descriptors and nine major strands of current research studies. The nine strands can further be grouped into five research themes: NOS, Knowledge Construction, Inquiry Ability, Explanatory-driven Inquiry, and Professional Development. With different levels of cohesiveness in network, these themes demonstrated that scientific inquiry was composed of different levels of abilities students need to achieve as well as the endeavors of teachers. Through exploring the network shared among most researchers, this study is expected to provide novice researchers information about elements that expert researchers usually consider and further, it is expected to give expert researchers some new directions to explore in research designs. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

In response to these calls, this study investigated the classroom practices of nine graduate assistants (GAs) who taught expository and inquiry laboratories that implemented an explicit and reflective (ER) pedagogy to teach NOS. The purpose of this qualitative study was to better understand the experiences that enabled or inhibited GA implementation of an ER strategy in a college setting. The findings revealed that achieving quality implementation in this setting was very difficult. Factors such as GAs' ability to foster meaningful classroom discussions, laboratory logistics (e.g. lack of time and supplies), and the value undergraduates and GAs saw in learning about NOS were identified by GAs and observed by the researchers as barriers to the technique maximizing its potential. Thus, for meaningful infusion of NOS into science curricula, pedagogical support for GAs to manage meaningful classroom discussions in support of NOS or other complex topics is recommended for an ER approach to NOS learning to be successful in college settings. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

However, very little is known about the impact of STSPs on teachers' and students' content knowledge growth or changes in their attitudes about science and scientists. This study addressed these two areas by examining an STSP called ""Students, Teachers, and Rangers and Research Scientists"" (STaRRS). STaRRS was incorporated into the existing long-standing education program ""Expedition: Yellowstone!"" For teachers, a pre-test, intervention, post-test research design was used to assess changes and gains in content knowledge, attitudes, and pedagogical practices. A quasi-experimental, pre-test-post-test, comparison group design was used to gauge gains in students' content knowledge and attitudes. Data analyses showed significant positive shifts in teachers' attitudes regarding science and scientists, and shifts in their pedagogical choices. Students showed significant content knowledge gains and increased positive attitudes regarding their perceptions of scientists.

We find that asynchronous notes contain more academic language and less social language, are more difficult to read, and are longer compared to PM. In addition, we find that the most active forum-posters are also the most active PM users, suggesting that PMing is not reducing their contribution to public discourse. Finally, we find that those who frequently PM are less likely to rapidly scan forum notes, and that they spend more time online than those who make less use of PM. We suggest that PM supports asynchronous discussions in the formation of a community of inquiry. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

The point of departure for the development of this notion is Shulman's original conceptualization of PCK that is rooted in Schwab's views of science. With respect to the aim of science teaching to enhance scientific literacy, this approach may offer science teachers an appropriate way to portray and reflect on the diversity of scientific practices within their teaching.

Modelling, as a pedagogical tool, involves the model construction, the exploration of model characteristics and the model application to a specific problem, resembling authentic activities of scientists and mathematicians (Herbert, 2003). Jonassen and Strobel (2006) state that in addition to modelling domain knowledge, learners can apply modelling skills in different ways: by modelling domain knowledge, by modelling problems (constructing problem spaces), by modelling systems and by modelling semantic structures. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of the Computational Experiment Mathematical Modelling (CEMM) approach on University students': a) reasoning abilities, b) learning performance, c) epistemological beliefs, and d) argumentation. Students worked in a learning environment which contained applications in Physics created by the author and all of them were based on mathematical models, as the model was considered as the fundamental unit of instruction (Hestenes, 1999). Fifty (50) pre-service primary school university students participated in this project and results indicated a strong relationship between students' learning performance, performance in the scientific reasoning abilities test, epistemic beliefs and the ability to use arguments during computational experiments. This paper suggests an implementable integration strategy that uses mathematical models for physics phenomena that are developed using algorithms, aiming to deepen students' conceptual understanding and scientific reasoning. After completing the course, the mechanics baseline test (MBT) and a test on Heat were administered. The results indicated that there was a significant difference in problem-solving skill test mean scores, as measured by the MBT, and the test on Heat among concrete, formal and postformal reasoners. Overall, this study provides evidence that scientific reasoning has a strong impact to learning performance, scientific reasoning, epistemological beliefs and argumentation while the methodology of the Computational Experiment provides essential tools to students to implement Inquiry based scenario. Students developed their scenarios using an open source repository using the computational experiment approach and created their experiments using the Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) laboratory approach.

As this lack of interest could result in fewer individuals qualified for scientific careers and a population unprepared to engage with scientific societal issues, it is imperative to investigate ways in which interest in school science can be increased. Studies have suggested that inquiry learning is one way to increase interest in science. Inquiry learning forms the core of the primary syllabus in Singapore; as such, we examine how inquiry practices may shape students' perceptions of science and school science. This study investigates how classroom inquiry activities relate to students' interest in school science. Data were collected from 425 grade 4 students who responded to a questionnaire and 27 students who participated in follow-up focus group interviews conducted in 14 classrooms in Singapore. Results indicate that students have a high interest in science class. Additionally, self-efficacy and leisure-time science activities, but not gender, were significantly associated with an increased interest in school science. Interestingly, while hands-on activities are viewed as fun and interesting, connecting learning to real-life and discussing ideas with their peers had a greater relation to student interest in school science. These findings suggest that inquiry learning can increase Singaporean students' interest in school science; however, simply engaging students in hands-on activities is insufficient. Instead, student interest may be increased by ensuring that classroom activities emphasize the everyday applications of science and allow for peer discussion. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

The other two themes 'Virtual others' and 'Communicating online'. The 'impact on progress and achievement' provide some insight into what is unique about the socio-emotional experience of collaborating online and how it can influence motivation and learning. The findings were considered from two perspectives of the role of emotion in learning: the socio-cognitive model of self-regulated learning and the community of inquiry framework (COI). An interdisciplinary approach was adopted by taking into account recent research in social cognitive neuroscience. Some practical recommendations about the deployment of technologies for group work online and for empowering students' understanding of the value of collaborative learning are made. The value of verbal immediacy practices as a way of counteracting the disembodied nature of the relational experience of others online is discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper proposes a new way for preservice teachers to learn science by designing and making a narrated stop-motion animation as an instructional resource to explain a science concept. In this paper, a simplified way for preservice teachers to design and make an animation called 'slowmation' (abbreviated from 'slow animation') is exemplified. A case study of three preservice primary teachers creating one from start to finish over 2 h was conducted to address the following research question: How do the preservice primary teachers create a slowmation and how does this process influence their science learning? The method of inquiry used a case study design involving pre- and post-individual interviews in conjunction with a discourse analysis of video and audio data recorded as they created a slowmation. The data illustrate how the preservice teachers' science learning was related to their prior knowledge and how they iteratively revisited the content through the construction of five representations as a cumulative semiotic progression: (i) research notes; (ii) storyboard; (iii) models; (iv) digital photographs; culminating in (v) the narrated animation. This progression enabled the preservice teachers to revisit the content in each representation and make decisions about which modes to use and promoted social interaction. Creating a slowmation facilitated the preservice teachers' learning about the life cycle of a ladybird beetle and revised their alternative conceptions. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

These assessments included three or four informal ""activity-oriented"" quizzes and discursive formative feedback rubrics supporting collective discourse, a ""curriculum-oriented"" examination of individual conceptual understanding, and a ""standards-oriented"" test measuring aggregated achievement of targeted standards. After two design-research cycles, worthwhile scientific argumentation and statistically significant gains were attained for two of the three packages on the exam and test.

The model of argumentative and scientifi{ligature}c inquiry was used as a design framework in the present study. According to the model, the inquiry of scientific topics was employed by groups of participants through experimentation and critical discussion sessions. The participants of the study were 35 PSTs, who teach middle school science to sixth through eighth grade students after graduation. The data were collected through video- and audio-recordings of the discussions made by PSTs in six inquiry-oriented laboratory sessions. For the analysis of data, pre-determined argumentation schemes by Walton were employed. The results illustrated that PSTs applied varied premises rather than only observations or reliable sources to ground their claims or to argue for a case or an action. It is also worthy of notice that the construction and evaluation of scientific knowledge claims resulted in different numbers and kinds of arguments. Results of this study suggest that designing inquiry-oriented laboratory environments, which are enriched with critical discussion, provides discourse opportunities that can support argumentation. Moreover, PSTs can be encouraged to support and promote argumentation in their future science classrooms if they engage in argumentation integrated instructional strategies. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

This case study examines the influence of scaffolded simulation-based inquiry learning on fifth-graders' (n = 21) models of the greenhouse effect. The pupils were asked to make annotated drawings about the greenhouse effect both before and after scaffolding through simulation-based instructional interventions. The data were analysed qualitatively to investigate the impact of the interventions on the representations that pupils used in their descriptions of the greenhouse effect. It was found that scaffolded simulation-based inquiry learning noticeably enriched the concepts pupils used in their representations leading to better understanding of the phenomenon.

Data sources included teacher belief surveys, teacher enactment surveys, a student multiple-choice assessment focused on defining and identifying science concepts and a student open-ended assessment focused on scientific inquiry. Results from the two hierarchical linear models indicate that there was significant variation between teachers in terms of student achievement. For the multiple-choice assessment, teachers who spent a larger percentage of time on group work and a smaller percentage of time lecturing had greater student learning. For the open-ended assessment, teachers who reported a higher frequency of students engaging in argument and sharing ideas had greater student learning while teachers who adapted the curriculum more had lower student learning.

This study explores the value of generating drawings versus selecting among alternatives to guide students to learn chemical reactions from a dynamic visualization of hydrogen combustion as part of an online inquiry unit. In prior research, generation has been more successful than selection in helping students distinguish among ideas to learn complex topics. However, selecting among perplexing alternatives may motivate learners to distinguish among ideas they might otherwise neglect. To test the value of selection for helping students distinguish ideas, this study contrasted complex selection (involving normative as well as non-normative ideas identified in prior research) from typical selection (involving images from the visualization). Results showed that all conditions improved student understanding and that typical selection was less effective than generation while complex selection was as successful as generation. In both generation and complex selection students revisited the visualization while learning, whereas revisiting was rare in typical selection. These results support the idea that distinguishing among common non-normative ideas is more valuable than distinguishing among images from the visualization. In addition, for students with low prior knowledge, both generation and complex selection had some advantages. Overall, the results suggest that students learning from complex visualizations could benefit from a combination of complex selection and generation. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

To do so, we used a qualitative (in vivo) research method that combines interviews, observations and open questionnaires with a group of five Israeli graduate students. The two major challenges that the students faced were the uncontrolled nature of field research (or complexity), and the nature of field setting, which isolated the students from authoritative guidance. In response to these challenges, the students developed a set of research skills which were expressed in this study by a series of three (metacognitive) strategies which we designated as 'protocol-dominated', 'intermediate' or 'field-dominated'. In order to develop such research skills, our subjects rely upon declarative and procedural knowledge. In contrast to declarative knowledge, learned in coursework, procedural knowledge is learned and activated via the situated experience of implementing research in authentic field environments. We also found that fieldwork complexity imposes itself the minute the students step into the field; potentially, this can negatively impact students' motivation. However, as the students accumulate field experience and acquire the knowledge and skills needed to overcome the field's complexity, their motivation improves. Recognizing the unique learning components connected to field research will help novice students better cope with fieldwork challenges, as well as help their advisers in guiding them. This work also has implications for designing inquiry curricula in field sciences for university and high-school students. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Initially, we were surprised when our students showed very little change on two different validated NOS questionnaires, adhering to seemingly memorized definitions of key NOS vocabulary such as ""science"" and ""experiment."" In contrast, on procedural measures of NOS understanding, students developed a decidedly sophisticated approach to answering scientific questions. Our data suggest that students' declarative understandings about the NOS are not a reliable measure of students' ability to engage productively in scientific practices and vice versa.

They can be particularly beneficial in informal and semiformal contexts where learners have more control over their learning goals and where motivation is often high. Inquiries in informal contexts are likely to be personally relevant in terms of topics of interest and capitalise on learners' location as learners decide what, where, when and whether to learn. There is considerable interest in how such benefits can be harnessed for more formal learning and one challenge is how to make inquiries personally relevant in such contexts. However, there is little literature that considers the structure needed to support informal and semiformal inquiry learning. This paper contributes to that literature by examining dimensions for researchers and designers to consider investigating or developing support for inquiries in informal or semiformal settings. The paper examines two case studies of inquiry learning in contrasting settings in order to understand more about learner control and how technology can support learners' inquiries. Case study one considers the use of web based software to support science inquiry learning by 14-15 year olds in a semiformal context, whilst the second case study reports on informal adult learners using their own mobile technologies to learn about landscape. These case studies are compared and contrasted in terms of the dimensions of learner control, location of learning, and the different support mechanisms for inquiry learning and a framework is proposed for considering these dimensions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A modification of the framework developed by Erduran et al.

Data were collected by video recording weekly peer-led sessions with a focus on two small groups. Analysis of this video data with the coding scheme and the framework revealed that students were mostly engaged in co-constructed arguments, with more than one student providing evidence and reasoning during group activities. Students often supported their claims with data and warrants but rarely offered backings. That is, they supported their answers with evidence and reasoning but did not often elaborate on their reasoning or further validate their explanations. However, the percentage of arguments containing backings increased when arguments contained contributions from more than one student rather than being presented by one individual. Another significant finding is that students were able to resolve wrong claims through argumentation without peer leader intervention, an indication of independent learning. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The first condition consisted of 23 students that used PM, the second condition consisted of 23 students that used VM, and the third condition consisted of 24 students that used the blended combination of PM and VM. In the case of the blended combination, the use of VM or PM was selected based on whether it provides an affordance that the other medium of experimentation (PM or VM) cannot provide. All conditions used the same inquiry-oriented curriculum materials and procedures. Conceptual tests were administered to assess students' understanding before, during, and after teaching.

Some researchers suggest that if students design all or parts of entire experiment, as part of an inquiry-based approach, it would overcome certain difficulties. It requires that a procedure be written for experimental design. The aim of this paper is to describe the characteristics of a procedure in science laboratories, in an educational context. As a starting point, this paper proposes a model in the form of a hierarchical task diagram that gives the general structure of any procedure. This model allows both the analysis of existing procedures and the design of a new inquiry-based approach. The obtained characteristics are further organized into criteria that can help both teachers and students assess a procedure during and after its writing. These results are obtained through two different sets of data. First, the characteristics of procedures are established by analysing laboratory manuals. This allows the organization and type of information in procedures to be defined. This analysis reveals that students are seldom asked to write a full procedure, but sometimes have to specify tasks within a procedure. Secondly, iterative interviews are undertaken with teachers. This leads to the list of criteria to evaluate the procedure. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

In this mixed-methods study, conceptions and enactment of inquiry for 60 National Board Certified Science Teachers (NBCSTs) across the secondary science disciplines of biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics were investigated. A situated cognitive framework was used. Through the analysis of portfolio text (n = 48) and participant interviews (n = 12), themes emerged for participants' conceptions and enactment of inquiry. Findings suggested that disciplinary differences exist between NBCSTs' conceptions and enactment of inquiry. Furthermore, individuals teaching in more than one discipline often held different conceptions of inquiry depending on the discipline in which they were teaching.

This research examined how much progress a teacher and 16 Primary Five (Grade 4) students in the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Programme could make towards the discourse needed for Bereiter and Scardamalia's model of knowledge creation. The study consisted of two phases: a five-month period focusing on the development of the classroom ethos and skills needed for this model (Phase 1), followed by a two-month inquiry into life cycles (Phase 2). In Phase 1, we examined the classroom practices that are thought to support knowledge creation and the early experiences of the students with a web-based inquiry environment, Knowledge Forum®. In Phase 2, we conducted a summative evaluation of the students' work in Knowledge Forum in the light of the model. The data sources included classroom video recordings, artefacts of the in-class work, the Knowledge Forum database, a science content test, questionnaires, and interviews. The findings indicate that the students made substantial progress towards the knowledge creation discourse, particularly regarding the social structure of this kind of discourse and, to a lesser extent, its idea-centred nature. They also made acceptable advances in scientific knowledge and appeared to enjoy this way of learning.

One class was provided with web-based reflective inquiry scaffolding (WorkSpace), while the other class used PowerPoint. The main data analyzed for this study consisted of each pair's written explanation and task-related artifacts. Findings show that the web-based reflective scaffolding supported students in providing valid evidence in support of their explanations. The analyses of the students' collaborative explanations showed no statistically significant differences that could be attributed to prior achievement between students in the WorkSpace condition, while differences were found between the different cognitive ability pairs in the PowerPoint class.

Thirty-eight grade six students from a Lebanese school participated in the study. The study used a pretest-posttest control-group design and focused on collecting mainly qualitative data. During each laboratory session, students worked in groups of two. Later, experimental group students answered open-ended questions about NOS then engaged in reflective discussions about NOS. Control group students answered open-ended questions about the content of the laboratory activities then participated in discussions of results of these activities. Data sources included an open-ended questionnaire used as pre- and posttest, answers to the open-ended questions that experimental group students answered individually during every session, transcribed videotapes of the reflective discussions of the experimental group, and semi-structured interviews. Results indicated that explicit and reflective discussions following inquiry-based laboratory activities enhanced students' views of the target NOS aspects more than implicit inquiry-based instruction. Moreover, implicit inquiry-based instruction did not substantially enhance the students' target NOS views.

Dyads communicated either face-to-face or through a chat tool. Students' reasoning during modeling was assessed by analyzing verbal protocols. In addition, we assessed the quality of student-built models. Results show that while model quality scores did not differ across both conditions, students communicating through chat compressed their interactions resulting in less time spent on surface reasoning, whereas students who communicated face-to-face spent significantly more time on surface reasoning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent research indicates that when science teachers do engage in socio-scientific discussion, the quality is poor and is teacher-centred where pupils’ views do not figure prominently (far less be clarified and integrated with their scientific learning). This has led to calls for such dialogue to be conducted by humanities teachers. The question arising from such thinking is: Do science teachers hold different conceptual models of discussion from their humanities colleagues? Using semi-structured interviews, three groups each of six teachers (experienced science teachers, experienced humanities teachers, and newly qualified science teachers) were interviewed in-depth in order to characterise their conceptual understanding of discussion as a teaching strategy. Analysis of the interview transcripts utilised the constant comparison approach of grounded theory. Five conceptual models of discussion emerged from an analysis of the data—discussion: (1) as a teacher-mediated discourse; (2) as open-ended inquiry; (3) for the development of reasoning skills; (4) as mediated transfer of knowledge to real-life contexts; and (5) as practice for democratic citizenship. The results confirmed that the science teachers’ emphasis tended to stress practice for democratic citizenship whereas the humanities teachers’ emphasis was more towards open-ended inquiry and for the development of reasoning skills. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Knowledge building is a deeply constructivist pedagogy and kind of inquiry learning focused on theory building. A strong indicator of engagement in knowledge building activity is the socio-cognitive dynamic of epistemic agency, in which students exercise a higher level of agency for setting forth their ideas and negotiating fit with those of others rather than relying on their teacher. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of (a) levels of participation, (b) facilitator styles and (c) metacognitive reflection on knowledge building in two blended, post-secondary education contexts. A study of a total of 67 undergraduate students suggest that high levels of participation, a supportive facilitator style, and ample opportunities for metacognitive reflection on the students' own participation strategies are most conducive for fostering epistemic agency for knowledge building.

More specifically, it investigates students' inquiry actions in three computer-based models of complex chemical systems when their goal is to construct an equation relating physical variables of the system. The study's participants were 368 high-school students who interacted with the Connected Chemistry (CC11) curriculum and completed identical pre- and post-test content knowledge questionnaires. The study explores whether and how students adapt to different mathematical behaviors of the system, examines how these explorations may relate to prior knowledge and learning in terms of conceptual and mathematical models, as well as components relating to understanding systems. Students' data-collection choices were mined and analyzed showing: (1) In about half the cases, mainly for two out of the three models explored, students conduct mathematically-astute (fit) explorations; (2) A third of the students consistently adapt their strategies to the models' mathematical behavior; (3) Fit explorations are associated with prior conceptual knowledge, specifically understanding of the system as complex, however, the three explorations' fitness is predicted by the understanding of distinct sets of systems' components; (4) Fit explorations are only somewhat associated with learning along complementary dimensions. These results are discussed with respect to 1) the importance of a conceptual understanding regarding individual system elements even when engaged in large-scale quantitative problem solving, 2) how distinct results for the different models relate to previous literature on conceptual understanding and particular affordances of the models, 3) the importance of engaging students in creating mathematical representations of scientific phenomena, as well as 4) educational applications of these results in learning environments. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using Bourdieu's 'thinking tools' of 'field', 'habitus' and 'capital', we case study the work of two teachers who both actively pursue the teaching and learning of science as inquiry. One teacher, Dan, has been a department chair since 2000, and has actively encouraged his department to embrace science as inquiry. The other teacher, Leslie, worked for one year in Dan's department before being transferred to another school where science teaching continues to be more traditional. Our work suggests that there are three crucial considerations for chairs seeking to lead the reform of science teaching within their department. The first of these is the development of a reform-minded habitus, as this appears to be foundational to the capital that can be expended in the leadership of reform. The second is an understanding of how to wield power and position in the promotion of reform. The third is the capacity to operate simultaneously and strategically within, and across, two fields; the departmental field and the larger science education field. This involves downplaying administrative logics, and foregrounding more inquiry-focused logics as a vehicle to challenge traditional science-teaching dispositions-the latter being typically dominated by concerns about curriculum 'coverage'. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Five types of literacies used by the students in their video outcomes for meaning representation were identified: text, action, narration, cinematography and acoustics. The findings also showed that there were three types of meaning representations with different characteristics: drama, documentary and photo story. The components identified to be required for meaning representation in video were attitude towards video representation, choice of inquiry topic, organizational skills, and data management. The findings informed us of the possibility of diversified use of literacies for meaning representation in different genres of videos.

We designed a week-long, technology-enhanced inquiry unit on car collisions. The unit uses new technologies to log students' experimentation choices. Physics students (n=148) in six diverse high schools studied the unit and responded to pretests, posttests, and embedded assessments. We scored students' experimentation using four methods: total number of trials, variability of variable choices, propensity to vary one variable at a time, and coherence between investigation goals and experimentation methods. Students made moderate, significant overall pretest to posttest gains on physics understanding. Coherence was a strong predictor of learning, controlling for pretest scores and the other experimentation measures. We identify three categories of experimenters (intentional, unsystematic, and exhaustive) and illustrate these categories with examples. The findings suggest that students must combine disciplinary knowledge of the investigation with intentional investigation of the inquiry questions in order to understand the nature of the variables. Mechanically executing well-established experimentation procedures (such as varying one variable at a time or comprehensively exploring the experimentation space) is less likely to lead students to valuable insights about complex tasks.

Most VLs convey an oversimplified view of scientific inquiry, which might handicap science education in terms of cultivating the ability to conduct authentic scientific inquiry and to solve everyday problems, or promoting students' scientific literacy. Ever since Duhem and Kuhn, philosophers of science have learned that the relationship between hypotheses and evidence is holistic rather than deductive; however the pedagogical value of this point has not received enough attention in science education.

To the best of our knowledge, no research work in the literature addressed the issue of automatically assessing the student's argumentation quality, and the teaching load of the teacher that used the online argumentation support environments is not alleviated. In this work, an intelligent argumentation assessment system based on machine learning techniques for computer supported cooperative learning is proposed. Learners' arguments on discussion board were examined by using argumentation element sequence to detect whether the learners address the expected discussion issues and to determine the argumentation skill level achieved by the learner. Learners are first assigned to heterogeneous groups based on their responses to the learning styles questionnaire given right before the beginning of learning activities on the e-learning platform. A feedback rule construction mechanism is used to issue feedback messages to the learners in case the argumentation assessment system detects that the learners go in a biased direction. The Moodle, an open source software e-learning platform, was used to establish the cooperative learning environment for this study. The experimental results exhibit that the proposed work is effective in classifying and improving student's argumentation level and assisting the students in learning the core concepts taught at a natural science course on the elementary school level. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To engage in SPAs and thus demonstrate abilities such as scientific inquiry, students must interact with various participants and communicate in a variety of ways. Using an analytical framework that draws on functional and interactional views of language, we analyzed video footage of one SPA, The World Down Under, enacted in three fifth-grade classrooms. The video analysis revealed a wide variety of language demands that students encountered during the SPA, including a range of participant structures (whole class, small group, and individual), communicative modes (interpreting language, presenting language, and engaging interpersonally), and 18 different texts. Moreover, the language demands differed by classroom. A closer look at two video episodes illustrated how this more expansive communicative context afforded two English Learners (ELs) with opportunities to navigate the language demands of the assessment. However, the same language demands could present challenges for ELs with lower levels of English proficiency. The findings contribute to science education by bringing attention to the nature and role of language in SPAs, which has only begun to be described in the literature. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

To date, researchers in science education have focused on two applications: results of sociological studies of science have been used to define new areas of content, generally referred to as Nature of Science (NOS). This has included research into students' understanding of the NOS, teachers' understanding of the NOS, and inclusion (or exclusion) of NOS themes in curricula. A second vein of inquiry has been investigations that consider the classroom as a microcosm of scientific discourse and inquiry. Such research has included investigations of student-tostudent and student-to-teacher interactions. In this paper, we present a third application for educational research - the investigation of teacher knowledge and practice as sociological phenomena. In addition to supporting scholarly research, we believe it can be a useful tool for illuminating the complexities of teaching that needs to be taken into account by policy makers and practitioners.

Students' cultural and linguistic backgrounds influence the knowledge they bring to the classroom, which impacts their degree of comfort with scientific practices. Consequently, the goal of this study was to investigate 5th grade students' views of explanation, argument, and evidence across three contexts-what scientists do, what happens in science classrooms, and what happens in everyday life. The study also focused on how students' abilities to engage in one practice, argumentation, changed over the school year. Multiple data sources were analyzed: pre- and post-student interviews, videotapes of classroom instruction, and student writing. The results from the beginning of the school year suggest that students' views of explanation, argument, and evidence, varied across the three contexts with students most likely to respond ""I don't know"" when talking about their science classroom. Students had resources to draw from both in their everyday knowledge and knowledge of scientists, but were unclear how to use those resources in their science classroom. Students' understandings of explanation, argument, and evidence for scientists and for science class changed over the course of the school year, while their everyday meanings remained more constant. This suggests that instruction can support students in developing stronger understanding of these scientific practices, while still maintaining distinct understandings for their everyday lives. Finally, the students wrote stronger scientific arguments by the end of the school year in terms of the structure of an argument, though the accuracy, appropriateness, and sufficiency of the arguments varied depending on the specific learning or assessment task. This indicates that elementary students are able to write scientific arguments, yet they need support to apply this practice to new and more complex contexts and content areas. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, critical review of the literature on the impact of computer simulations on science teaching and learning, with the goal of summarizing what is currently known and providing guidance for future research. We report on the outcomes of 61 empirical studies dealing with the efficacy of, and implications for, computer simulations in science instruction. The overall findings suggest that simulations can be as effective, and in many ways more effective, than traditional (i.e. lecture-based, textbook-based and/or physical hands-on) instructional practices in promoting science content knowledge, developing process skills, and facilitating conceptual change. As with any other educational tool, the effectiveness of computer simulations is dependent upon the ways in which they are used. Thus, we outline specific research-based guidelines for best practice. Computer simulations are most effective when they (a) are used as supplements; (b) incorporate high-quality support structures; (c) encourage student reflection; and (d) promote cognitive dissonance. Used appropriately, computer simulations involve students in inquiry-based, authentic science explorations. Additionally, as educational technologies continue to evolve, advantages such as flexibility, safety, and efficiency deserve attention. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

That is, in virtually all aspects of modelling, from developing a question to judging between competing models that might answer that question, an individual is engaged in persuasive acts. Those acts may be private or public. They may be mental, written or oral, but they are about judging ideas and making sense of them; convincing oneself or others that the ideas and ways of looking at and explaining a phenomenon are useful. These acts are what scientists find exciting. They are what make science intellectually interesting and challenging. Inviting students into this practice is one way to help them learn both the content and process of science. This paper introduces a framework that is attentive to the research on how people learn while simultaneously pushing for curriculum and instruction that engages students in elements of the practice of science. We explore how this framework can be used to foster argumentation by describing the theoretical underpinnings of the framework and using classroom examples to illustrate the utility of the framework for promoting argumentation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Longitudinal observations from Mrs. Charles' 5th grade science classroom forced us to carefully and deliberately consider who exactly was responsible for the change in the class activities and norms. We provide empirical evidence to show how a focus on the teacher can easily overlook the complex dynamics of the classroom. The data reveal that students had a substantive and generative role in the class's arrival at the different instantiations of scientific inquiry-the nature and form of inquiry-that were constructed each year. We argue that, in an environment where a teacher carefully attends and responds to student thinking, the nascent resources students have for reasoning about phenomena can affect not only the conceptual ideas that emerge, but also influence what inquiry activities or practices become established as normative and productive over time. Our work with Mrs. Charles illuminates an important methodological concern with research on teacher development as well as the construct of teacher learning progressions; research accounts that focus primarily on the teacher may overlook the classroom norms that are negotiated between teacher and student, and thereby provide an incomplete portrayal of the teacher's activity within one classroom and the teacher's progress across multiple years. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

In the past decade, more and more geography teachers have become interested in the possibilities of using GIS in secondary education. However, teaching with GIS is complex, and little is known about how to do so in an optimal way. Therefore, an Educational Design Research study (EDR) was conducted with the aim to explore the characteristics of an optimal design for GIS-supported geographic inquiry projects. In this EDR study, a project was developed via progressive cycles of designing, testing, and evaluating, together with teachers from different schools. This paper summarizes the outcomes of the EDR study, and presents some design principles for GIS-supported inquiry-based geography education. Teachers could use these design principles to design and conduct GIS-supported geographic inquiry projects, and in such a way raise their geography lessons to a higher level. This paper also shows that although GIS provides many opportunities for enhancing inquiry-based geography projects, it also holds many conditions for its use to be optimal. GIS-supported inquiry-based geography education requires more than providing appropriate software, tasks, and coaching to ensure that students do not get stuck. In order to effectively raise students' geographic thinking to a higher level, the project should offer a considerable amount of guidance: it should include several preparatory and evaluative tasks based on a good domain-specific theory for use in educational settings. In addition, teachers should coach students in structuring, correcting, and expanding their geographic thinking via dialogical teaching. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Article","Scopus"

This research investigates how dynamic visualizations, compared to static illustrations, can support middle school students in developing an integrated understanding of energy in photosynthesis. Two hundred 7th-grade students were randomly assigned to either a dynamic or a static condition and completed a web-based inquiry unit that encourages students to make connections among energy concepts in photosynthesis. While working on the inquiry unit, students in the dynamic condition interacted with a dynamic visualization of energy transformation, whereas students in the static condition interacted with a series of static illustrations of the same concept. The results showed that students in both conditions added new, scientific ideas about energy transformation and developed a more coherent understanding of energy in photosynthesis. However, when comparing the two conditions, we found a significant advantage of dynamic visualization over static illustrations. Students in the dynamic condition were significantly more successful in articulating the process of energy transformation in the context of chemical reactions during photosynthesis. Students in the dynamic condition also demonstrated a more integrated understanding of energy in photosynthesis by linking their ideas about energy transformation to other energy ideas and observable phenomena of photosynthesis than those students in the static condition. This study, consistent with other research, shows that dynamic visualizations can more effectively improve students' understanding of abstract concepts of molecular processes than static illustrations. The results of this study also suggest that with appropriate instructional support, such as making predictions and distinguishing among ideas, both dynamic visualizations and static illustrations can benefit students. This study underscores the importance of curriculum design in ensuring that dynamic visualizations add value to science instructional materials.

Data sources included curriculum surveys, videotape observations of focal teachers, and pre- and post-tests from 1,234 students.

This study examined two types of model progression as means to compensate for these skill deficiencies. Model order progression (MOP), the predicted optimal variant, gradually increases the specificity of the relations between variables, whereas model elaboration progression (MEP) gradually expands the number of variables in the task. The study utilized a between-subject design with three conditions: a MOP condition (n = 28), a MEP condition (n = 26), and a control condition without model progression (n = 30). Consistent with expectations, model progression enhanced students' task performance; a comparison among the two model progression conditions confirmed the predicted superiority of the MOP condition. These results are discussed in relation to the inconsistent findings from prior research. Based on this discussion ways to optimize model order progression are advanced. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Scopus"

In the UK, pressures on curriculum time, rising costs and heightened concern over students' safety are curtailing residential experiences. Collaboration between several key fieldwork providers across the UK created an extensive programme of residential courses for 11-14-year-olds in London schools from 2004 to 2008. Some 33,000 students from 849 schools took part. This paper draws on the evaluation of the programme that gathered questionnaire, interview and observational data from 2,706 participating students, 70 teachers and 869 parents/carers from 46 schools, mainly in deprived areas of the city. Our findings revealed that students' collaborative skills improved and interpersonal relationships were strengthened and taken back to school. Gains were strongest in social and affective domains, together with behavioural improvements for some students. Individual cognitive gains were revealed more convincingly during face-to-face interviews, rather than through survey items. Students from socially deprived backgrounds benefitted from exposure to learning environments which promoted authentic practical inquiry. Over the 5-year programme, combined physical adventure and real-world experiences proved to be popular with students and their teachers, and opened up opportunities for learning and doing science in ways not often accessible in urban school environments. Further programmes have been implemented in other parts of the UK as a result of the London experience, which build upon the provision of mixed curriculum-adventure course design. The popularity and apparent success of these combination courses suggest that providers need to consider the value of developing similar programmes in the future. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

The literature synthesis examines research findings on grade 6-12 student learning gains and losses using virtual laboratories and science-simulation software, derived from a review of 79 relevant studies identified. Based on that literature, significant aspects of how such products influence student learning are identified. Tables summarize the research-based evidence about best practices in instructional design for such virtual lab and simulation products. Some products were then reviewed as case studies to determine in what ways and to what extent they implement such research-identified best practices. The overall goal was to consider where the most progress is being made in effective virtual-lab and simulation products, and what directions future development should take.

In this study, we analyzed epistemic criteria for good models generated by 324 middle-school students. After evaluating a range of scientific models, but before extensive instruction or experience with model-based reasoning practices, students generated lists of criteria of good scientific models. Students' individual lists of criteria were compared to expert criteria, identified by philosophers of science, and with findings from previous research on students' understanding of modeling. The most commonly listed criteria referred to the clarity, pictorial form, and explanatory function of models. Almost a quarter of the students included criteria relating to model fit with evidence. Students' criteria provided insights into their understanding of the explanatory and descriptive goals of models; the constitutive, communicative, and epistemic features of models; and the role of evidence in supporting models. Collectively, students demonstrated familiarity with a wide range of modeling ideas that can be leveraged in instruction to promote deeper understandings of the modeling practice.

The natural sciences as a discipline - a latecomer to preschool curricula - and the internationally known approach, Reggio Emilia, interested educators and researchers, but there was little research about science in a Reggio Emilia classroom. The current research aimed to gain insight into natural science experiences in a Reggio Emilia-inspired classroom. To gain in-depth information, this inquiry-based study adapted a research design with ethnographic data collection techniques (i.e., interview, observation, document/artifact collection, and field-notes), namely Spradley's Developmental Research Sequence Method, which was a well-known, pioneer ethnographic method. The data were analyzed from an interpretive perspective using multiple lenses. These lenses included Spradley's DRS for the classroom culture, Corsaro's peer culture theory, the Reggio Emilia approach, and Ohio's Early Learning Content Standards. The study involved 18 preschoolers, 10 teachers, and a program director. The results indicated that the Reggio Emilia-inspired preschool offered a science-rich context that triggered and supported preschoolers' inquiries, and effectively engaged preschoolers' hands, heads, and hearts with science. The natural sciences learning in this Reggio Emilia-inspired preschool classroom met and exceeded some of Ohio's prekindergarten standards.

We use both case study and an experimental approach to investigate how laboratory materials guide the planning, context, creativity, and timing of ideas shared among students.

Participants were undergraduate junior and senior students who were enrolled in an earth science education course offered for preservice secondary science teachers at a university in Korea. The undergraduate students conducted, as a course activity, earth scientific inquiry according to the Abductive Inquiry Model (AIM) to explain a typhoon's anomalous path. Data sources included students' presentation materials, written reports, and interviews with five selected participants. The data were analyzed qualitatively in collaboration with a practicing earth scientist. The findings of the study revealed the characteristics of students' inquiry performance in each phase of the AIM. During the exploration phase, the students investigated earth scientific phenomena with provided data and transformed the data into new forms to discover problems to be explained abductively. In the examination phase, the students activated and expanded their background knowledge to find appropriate rules for abductive inference. Furthermore, they created new rules, which contained hypothetical explanations for the phenomena in question. The selection phase provided the students with opportunities to evaluate their hypotheses with empirical and theoretical criteria and choose more plausible ones.

The focus is on one girl's science activities in her home and hobby pursuits from fourth to seventh grade to create an empirical account of how youth gain access to scientific knowledge and science practices in informal learning environments. The analysis uses fieldnotes, videotape recordings, and transcripts centered on the epistemic, social, and material resources related to learning in biology. The focal participant of the study, Penelope, engaged with animal activities in her home and hobby pursuits in ways that overlapped scientific practice. She (1) engaged in observational inquiry, (2) used media to understand animal behavior, (3) tinkered with feeding to keep her animals healthy, and (4) manipulated her animals and animal-related artifacts to create routines and safe indoor habitats. Penelope used these four competencies to gain access to new science learning situations in school and afterschool settings. Yet, as she participated in science practices around animals, she sought to be recognized as uninterested in science. Instead, she used her talk and activities to be recognized in animal caretaking roles in the settings that mattered to her. Penelope's behavior of distancing herself from science while still seeking out experiences to learn about animal biology shows that recognition work is a complex negotiation between aspects of one's self and of science. Implications to theories are drawn related to science education and recognition work. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

To understand the complexity of teachers' conflicts in practical work, this study examines teachers' ideas about teaching and learning that influence teachers' decision-making and action on teaching practical work. More important than knowing technical-rational aspects of practical work is to understand the internal contradictions that teachers have to resolve within themselves regarding their capabilities and beliefs about science teaching and practical work. Using stories and experiences of 38 third-year university students in a science method course in Korea, we seek to understand the conflicts and negotiations that they experience as they make decisions regarding practical work throughout their course. Reflective writings and group discussions on their lived experiences and concerns were used to probe participants' ideas on teaching using practical work. From written and verbal data, themes were saturated in terms of the aspects which could (dis)encourage their practice. Results suggest that there are multifactorial challenges in preservice teachers' understandings and concerns in practical work. Besides time, materials, and curriculum, pedagogical assumptions and values also compositely challenge the minds of teachers. As the pre-service elementary teachers negotiated within themselves the importance of science in classroom and social levels, the question is raised about their identities as pre-service elementary teachers to appreciate the balance between science teaching and practical work. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

As we document the nature of children's ways of explaining, imagining, and representing the properties of water, we demonstrate the constructions of understandings as displayed and emergent from these interactions. The study has generated outcomes about the discursive ways of young children's enacting of knowledge about science, as the analysis reveals that by positioning scientific inquiry as a fluid process children were able to enact science collaboratively and through multimodal means.

The review is based on 191 conceptual and empirical journal articles published between 1995 and 2008. Four broad categories of change strategies were developed to capture core differences within this body of literature: disseminating curriculum and pedagogy, developing reflective teachers, enacting policy, and developing shared vision. STEM education researchers largely write about change in terms of disseminating curriculum and pedagogy. Faculty development researchers largely write about change in terms of developing reflective teachers. Higher education researchers largely write about change in terms of enacting policy. New work often does not build on prior empirical or theoretical work. Although most articles claim success of the change strategy studied, evidence presented to support these claims is typically not strong. For example, only 21% of articles that studied implementation of a change strategy were categorized as presenting strong evidence to support claims of success or failure of the strategy. These analyses suggest that the state of change strategies and the study of change strategies are weak, and that research communities that study and enact change are largely isolated from one-another. In spite of the weak state of the literature, some conclusions related to the design of change strategies can be drawn from this review. Two commonly used change strategies are clearly not effective: developing and testing ""best practice"" curricular materials and then making these materials available to other faculty and ""top-down"" policy-making meant to influence instructional practices. Effective change strategies: are aligned with or seek to change the beliefs of the individuals involved; involve long-term interventions, lasting at least one semester; require understanding a college or university as a complex system and designing a strategy that is compatible with this system. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Evidence of technology-enhanced problem-solving teaching and learning in schools has been scarce, understanding how to support students' problem solving in classroom-based, technology-enhanced learning environments has been limited, and coherent frameworks to guide implementation have been slow to emerge. Whereas researchers have examined the use and impact of scaffolds in mathematics, science, and reading, comparatively little research has focused on scaffolding learning in real-world, everyday classroom settings. Web-based systems have been developed to support problem solving, but implementations suggest variable enactment and inconsistent impact. The purpose of this article is to identify critical issues in scaffolding students' technology-enhanced problem solving in everyday classrooms. First, we examine two key constructs (problem solving and scaffolding) and propose a framework that includes essential dimensions to be considered when teachers scaffold student problem solving in technology-rich classes. We then investigate issues related to peer-, teacher-, and technology-enhanced scaffolds, and conclude by examining implications for research. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Data were collected through focus group interviews conducted at seven occasions with 32 students from six well-known Swedish universities. The theoretical framework is a sociocultural and pragmatist perspective on language and learning, introducing the notion of pivot terms to operationalise language use as a habit and mediated action. We describe three different customs of using the term 'hypothesis' within four cultural institutions that can be said to constitute science teacher education in Sweden. Students were found to habitually use the term hypothesis as meaning a guess about an outcome. This is contrasted to the function of this term in scientific research as a tentative explanation. We also found differences in how this term was used between the pure science courses given by the science departments of universities and science education courses taken only by teacher students. Findings also included further support for school students hypothesis fear reported in an earlier study. It is discussed how these findings can obstruct learning and teaching about the nature of scientific inquiry. Constructivist theories of learning are suggested as a possible origin of these problems. The findings are also related to curricular reform and development. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

A special concern lies in the development of research perspectives and tools for investigating ways, in which teachers are faced with complex and various situations in the sense-making of science-related issues, and subsequent pedagogic issues. Based on an empirical examination of Korean teachers' sense-making of their curricular practice, the paper develops a narrative approach to teachers' perspectives and knowledge by considering the value of stories as sense-making tools for reflective questioning of what is worth teaching, how and why. By employing the idea of 'repertoire', the study regards teachers' stories about their environment-related personal and teaching experiences as offering angles with which to understand teachers' motivation and reflection in curricular development and implementation. Furthermore, three empirical cases present ways in which the nature of knowledge and understanding is recognised and potentially integrated into pedagogies through teachers' narratives. Finally, the paper argues for the need to reconsider the role of the science teacher in addressing environmental and sustainability-related issues, in ways that facilitate teachers' reflexive interpretation of meanings in cultural texts and the construction of pedagogic text. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

This study examined students' inquiry learning skills and content knowledge when they utilized a virtual learning environment called Supervolcano: Kikai Caldera. The present study specifically explored how the timing of teacher-based metacognitive scaffolding in combination with different types of computer-based procedural scaffolding affected students' science inquiry learning. To answer this question, a 2 × 2 factorial design was conducted. One factor examined continuous and faded computer-based procedural scaffolds, and the other factor investigated early and late teacher-based metacognitive scaffolds. Students who received both continuous computer-based procedural scaffolding and early teacher-based metacognitive scaffolding performed best in acquiring scientific inquiry skills. Students using both faded computer-based procedural and early teacher-based metacognitive scaffolding had the worst performance in learning scientific inquiry skills.

However, there is little discussion in the science education literature on this topic and on how students can be supported in developing such skills. In this article, we describe an instructional design framework, which we call the Credibility Assessment Framework, to scaffold high school students' collaborative construction of evidence-based decisions and their assessment of the credibility of evidence. The framework was employed for the design of a web-based reflective inquiry environment on a socio-scientific issue, and was enacted with 11th grade students. The article describes the components of the Credibility Assessment Framework and provides the details and results of an empirical study illustrating this framework in practice. The results are presented in the form of a case study of how 11th grade students investigated and evaluated scientific data relating to the cultivation of genetically modified plants. Multiple kinds of data were collected, including pre- and post-tests of students' conceptual understanding and their skills in assessing the credibility of evidence, and videotapes of students' collaborative inquiry sessions. The analysis of the pre- and post-tests on students' conceptual understanding of Biotechnology and their skills in assessing the credibility of evidence revealed statistically significant learning gains. Students' work in task-related artifacts and the analysis of two groups' videotaped discussions showed that students became sensitive to credibility criteria, questioned the sources of data and correctly identified sources of low, moderate, and high credibility. Implications for designers and educators regarding the application of this framework are discussed. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Teachers with diverse skills and science capacities came together in Professional Learning Communities, one full day each week throughout an academic year, to create a classroom culture for science instruction. Approximately 80 teachers each year received professional development in science content and pedagogy using the same inquiry-based constructivist methods that the teachers were expected to use in their classrooms. During this four-year study, scientists and educators worked with elementary teachers in a year-long model science lab environment to provide science content and science pedagogy. The effectiveness of the program was measured using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods that allowed the researchers to triangulate the findings from quantitative measures, such as content test and surveys, with the emerging themes from the qualitative instruments, such as class observations and participant interviews. Results showed that, in all four years, teachers from the REMSL Treatment group have significantly increased their science content knowledge (p & 0.05).

The experimental task was designed to promote spontaneous record keeping compared to previous task designs by increasing the saliency of task requirements, with the design goal of making the relationship between record keeping and inquiry strategies more explicit and visible. Compared to previous studies, this new task design resulted both in a higher amount of record keeping overall and in a higher quality of information, which is interpreted to be a result of increased participants' metatask and metastrategic knowledge arising from greater engagement with the task. The study found a significant relationship between the quality of students' record keeping and the inquiry strategies that were investigated. However, this relationship varied depending on the type of inquiry strategy. Strategies that are employed during the design of experiments (i.e., factorial combination strategy and control-of-variables strategy [CVS]) were statistically related to the number of complete comments (plans and intents), but not with the total number of comments. In contrast, the study found that for strategies employed while evaluating evidence (i.e., drawing inferences), student production of quality records is a necessary but not sufficient condition for effective evidence evaluation; in addition to recording high-quality information, students must also review their records (both from design and evaluation phases). © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Review","Scopus"

The tasks involved students collecting and making sense of complex data, collecting data to address conflicting hypotheses, and, in a paper-based activity, discussing pre-collected data about an experiment. Significant differences in the quality of argumentation prompted by the tasks were apparent. The paper-based task generated the most argumentation units per unit time. Where students carried out an experiment, argumentation was often brief, as reliance on their data was paramount. Measurements were given credence by frequency and regularity of collection, while possibilities for error were ignored.

Acceptance of these ends reduces the role of disciplinary context; the ""Footprints Puzzle"" and Oregon's ""Inquiry Scoring Guide"" illustrate this point. In the Footprints Puzzle, students are challenged to distinguish observations from inferences to learn about the nature of science or the culture of science. Oregon's Inquiry Scoring Guide separates content knowledge from inquiry skills. Given long-standing discredit of ""the"" scientific method, modern views emphasize the diversity of inquiry methods and explanatory ideals across disciplines. Paleontologists, for example, reconstruct the behavior of extinct beasts from fossil footprints using methods of inquiry responsive to this aim. Figuring out dinosaur locomotion depends upon making analogies to the limb structure and behavior of extant species. The history of the Footprints Puzzle demonstrates that an enduring adherence to ""a process approach"" obscures how conceptualization intertwines with methodology.

To become well-started beginning elementary teachers capable of engaging their students in inquiry-based science, preservice elementary teachers need to learn to use science curriculum materials effectively. Thus far, few other studies have investigated how preservice elementary teachers adapt science curriculum materials to better reflect five essential features of inquiry-based teaching and learning articulated in contemporary science education reform. Findings from previous research suggest that preservice elementary teachers can productively adapt science curriculum materials to make them more inquiry-based. The mixed-methods study presented here extends these findings by illustrating the essential features of inquiry preservice teachers emphasize in their curricular adaptations and the specific types of adaptations the preservice teachers make. Results suggest that the preservice teachers consistently attended to all five essential features of inquiry in their curricular adaptations. The types of adaptations that they made to promote each of these features of inquiry provide insight into their curriculum design practices and learning about science as inquiry that can serve as important leverage points for teacher education experiences and curriculum materials designed to support elementary teachers' science teaching practice and learning. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Web-based, real-time data could, therefore, offer a promising tool for conducting scientific inquiries within classroom environments. This study used a quasi-experimental research design to investigate the effects of inquiry-based instruction coupled with archived online data. Ninety-six preservice teachers in a four-year elementary science teacher-training program participated in this study. The students were enrolled in three sections of the methods course, and these existing groups were randomly assigned to the treatment groups: traditional instruction, traditional instruction supported with a simulation, and inquiry-based instruction with archived online data. Data were collected with structured interviews and analyzed with the constant comparative method and one-way ANOVA. Before the instructional interventions, none of the participants had a scientific understanding of tides, and 15% of the participants had no conceptual understanding of tides at all. After instruction, 72% of the participants who received inquiry-based instruction with archived online data were categorized as having scientific conceptual understandings; 46% of participants who received traditional instruction supported with a simulation were categorized as having scientific conceptual understandings; and 43% of participants who received traditional instruction were categorized as having scientific conceptual understandings. Statistical analyses showed that the group receiving inquiry-based instruction with archived online data performed significantly better than the other two instructional groups. Inquiry-based instruction with archived online data can be used to effectively perform inquiry activities within science classes; it might be used at different grade levels to teach a variety of scientific content. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The study was conducted in a single section of an undergraduate general chemistry lab course offered at a large two-year community college located in the southeast USA. The intervention took place over a 15-week semester and consisted of six laboratory activities. During each laboratory activity, the undergraduates wrote investigation reports, participated in a double-blind group peer review of the reports, and revised their reports based on the reviews. The reports written during each laboratory activity were used to examine changes in the students' writing skills over time and to identify aspects of scientific writing that were the most difficult for the undergraduates in this context. The reviews produced by the students during each report were used to evaluate how well undergraduates engage in the peer-review process. The results of a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the reports and reviews indicate that the participants made significant improvements in their ability to write in science and were able to evaluate the quality of their peers' writing with a relatively high degree of accuracy, but they also struggled with several aspects of scientific writing. The conclusions and implications of the study include recommendations for helping undergraduate students learn to write by writing to learn in science and new directions for future research. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Research has shown, however, that many high school graduates lack fundamental understandings in genetics necessary to make informed decisions about issues and emerging technologies in this domain, such as genetic screening, genetically modified foods, etc. Genetic literacy entails understanding three interrelated models: a genetic model that describes patterns of genetic inheritance, a meiotic model that describes the process by which genes are segregated into sex cells, and a molecular model that describes the mechanisms that link genotypes to phenotypes within an individual. Currently, much of genetics instruction, especially in terms of the molecular model, occurs at the high school level, and we know little about the ways in which middle school students can reason about these models. Furthermore, we do not know the extent to which carefully designed instruction can help younger students develop coherent and interrelated understandings in genetics. In this paper, we discuss a research study aimed at elucidating middle school students' abilities to reason about the three genetic models. As part of our research, we designed an eight-week inquiry unit that was implemented in a combined sixth- to eighth-grade science classroom. We describe our instructional design and report results based on an analysis of written assessments, clinical interviews, and artifacts of the unit. Our findings suggest that middle school students are able to successfully reason about all three genetic models. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Two groups of sixth grade students were selected for this study: an experimental group composed of 66 students (34 boys and 32 girls); and a control group composed of 68 students (35 boys and 33 girls). The students in the experimental group taught with a DGE, while the students in the control group received textbook-based direct instruction. An achievement test was administered as pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test in both groups. Qualitative data were collected through videotaped classroom observations. The results showed that the DGE together with open-ended explorations significantly improved students' performances in polygons and congruency and similarity of polygons. Furthermore, students in the experimental group showed greater interest and motivation toward learning geometry compared to those in the control group whom often showed lack of interest and curiosity. Also, students' comments and interpretations during lessons and tests were more accurate and advanced in the experimental group as they engage more in the DGE. Moreover, qualitative data suggested that boys showed greater interest in the computer-based learning environment than girls in the experimental groups although no significant gender effect on achievement was found. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A semiotic framework is adopted wherein teacher pronominal choices are viewed as symbolically expressing cognitive meanings (scientific thinking, forms of expression, and concepts) and indexically communicating social meanings (hidden messages about social and personal aspects of science—human agency, science membership, and gender). Through the construction of interactional maps and micro‐ethnographic analysis of classroom video‐recordings, I focus specifically on participant examples (oral descriptions of actual or hypothetical situations wherein the teacher presents herself and/or her students as characters to illustrate topics under discussion). This analysis revealed that the teacher use of the generalised you communicated to the students how to mean scientifically (i.e. to speak like a scientist), while I communicated scientific ways of thinking and reasoning. Furthermore, teacher pronouns communicated the social nature of science (NOS) (e.g. science as a human enterprise) as well as multiple teacher–student–science relational frames that were inclusive of some students (mainly boys) but excluded girls (i.e. positioned them as science outsiders). Exclusive use of he was taken as indicative of a gender bias. It is argued that science teachers should become more aware of the range of personal pronouns available for science instruction, their advantages and constraints for science discussions, their potential as instructional tools for humanising and personalising impersonal science curricula as well as the risk of ‘NOS’ miscommunication. © 2011 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Data were collected from eight case study students in the form of individual interviews, classroom observations, and student artifacts. Analysis of these data revealed that students were able to extend their C3 science understandings beyond the classroom door by developing and expressing science agency in the following ways: (1) critically analyze the conditions of their food environment, (2) purposefully make healthier choices, and (3) expand the food and activity options available to themselves and others. Through participation in the C3 curriculum, and the science content and practices addressed therein, students began to view their worlds with a more critical mindset and to devise ways to transform themselves and the conditions of their own and others' lives.

The interaction group conducted multiple experiments with the visualization by varying the amount of energy provided to ignite the reaction. The generation group integrated more ideas about chemical reactions and made more precise interpretations of the visualization than the interaction group. Embedded assessments show that generation motivated students to interpret the visualization carefully and led to more productive explanations about ideas represented in the dynamic visualization. In contrast, the interaction group was less successful in linking the visualization to underlying concepts and observable phenomena and wrote less detailed explanations.

An experimental IELC (n = 7 teachers; n = 201 students) group and control non-IELC (n = 6 teachers; n = 184 students) group of elementary teachers and students were studied to determine whether significant differences could be found over a one-year intervention period. Pre- and post-measures were used to track teachers' attitude about teaching science and student attitude about science as well as student citizenship beliefs. Additionally, post-measures of student attitude toward the learning environment and teacher quality classroom observations were made of both teacher groups. Sequential (or hierarchical) ordinary least-squares regression analyzes were conducted to investigate which factors influenced teacher attitudes about the initial three outcome measures investigated (i.e. teacher attitude about teaching science, student attitude about science, and student citizenship beliefs), an independent t-test was conducted to investigate differences in student attitude toward the learning environment, and descriptive statistics were used to investigate teacher quality across the two groups.

The project studied the psychometric quality, feasibility, and utility of simulation-based science assessments designed to serve formative purposes during a unit and to provide summative evidence of end-of-unit proficiencies. The frameworks of evidence-centered assessment design and model-based learning shaped the specifications for the assessments. The simulations provided the three most common forms of accommodations in state testing programs: audio recording of text, screen magnification, and support for extended time. The SimScientists program at WestEd developed simulation-based, curriculum-embedded, and unit benchmark assessments for two middle school topics, Ecosystems and Force & Motion. These were field-tested in three states. Data included student characteristics, responses to the assessments, cognitive labs, classroom observations, and teacher surveys and interviews. UCLA CRESST conducted an evaluation of the implementation. Feasibility and utility were examined in classroom observations, teacher surveys and interviews, and by the six-state Design Panel. Technical quality data included AAAS reviews of the items' alignment with standards and quality of the science, cognitive labs, and assessment data. Student data were analyzed using multidimensional Item Response Theory (IRT) methods. IRT analyses demonstrated the high psychometric quality (reliability and validity) of the assessments and their discrimination between content knowledge and inquiry practices. Students performed better on the interactive, simulation-based assessments than on the static, conventional items in the posttest. Importantly, gaps between performance of the general population and English language learners and students with disabilities were considerably smaller on the simulation-based assessments than on the posttests. The Design Panel participated in development of two models for integrating science simulations into a balanced state science assessment system. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

These students are simultaneously learning science and the surrounding academic language in their second language. This study investigates the potential value of providing 8th grade Spanish-speaking English language learners access to content and supports in both English and Spanish as opposed to an English-only format in an online science inquiry environment. Learning outcomes are compared between the two conditions on an immediate post-test in English, a delayed post-test in English, a delayed post-test in Spanish, and a written essay in English in the form of a letter to the governor. The outcomes suggest significant benefits for providing ELL students with access to content and supports in both English and Spanish as opposed to the English-only format. The findings of this study carry important policy implications in light of the growing English-only political movements in the United States and similar political movements in other countries. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary goal of this study was to assess elementary teachers' science teaching efficacy as they participated in a large-scale professional development program and to determine the relationship of these beliefs with student learning. It was found that elementary teachers who participated in a long-term, intense (over 100 contact hours annually) science professional development program displayed significant gains in their science teaching self-efficacy. Several background variables were found to be predictive of teacher beliefs including how often teachers spend teaching science. Males tended to display more positive beliefs than their female counterparts. Although a small portion of the variance was explained, teacher beliefs and the number of hours participating in the research-based professional development program were significantly predictive of students' science achievement. Other factors may be involved in teachers' beliefs and their connection with student learning, including classroom practices, curriculum materials, support systems, and student background variables.

The present study examined the development of this scientific tool and its consequent adoption into the context of high school science teaching in the form of the Biology Student Workbench (BSW). Participants included scientists, programmers, science educators, and science teachers who played key roles along the pathway of the design and development of BW, and/or the adaptation and implementation of BSW in high school science classrooms. Participants also included four teachers who, with their students, continue to use BSW. Data sources included interviews, classroom observations, and relevant artifacts. Contrary to what often is advocated as a major benefit accruing from the integration of authentic scientific tools into precollege science teaching, classroom enactments of BSW lacked elements of inquiry and were teacher-centered with prescribed convergent activities. Students mostly were preoccupied with following instructions and a focus on science content. The desired and actual realizations of BSW fell on two extremes that reflected the disparity between scientists' and educators' views on science, inquiry science teaching, and the related roles of technological tools. Research on large-scale adoptions of technological tools into precollege science classrooms needs to expand beyond its current focus on teacher knowledge, skills, beliefs, and practices to examine the role of the scientists, researchers, and teacher educators who often are involved in such adoptions. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Matched-quartets were created based on the pre-test results of 50 elementary school students and divided randomly into a simulation implicit (SI), simulation explicit (SE), combination implicit (CI) and combination explicit (CE) conditions. The results demonstrated that the instructional support had an expected effect on students' understanding of electric circuits when they used the simulation alone; pure procedural guidance (SI) was insufficient to promote conceptual understanding, but when the students were given more guidance for the discovery process (SE) they were able to gain significant amount of subject knowledge. A surprising finding was that when the students used the simulation and the real circuits in parallel, the explicit instruction (CE) did not seem to elicit much additional gain for their understanding of electric circuits compared to the implicit instruction (CI). Instead, the explicit instruction slowed down the inquiry process substantially in the combination environment (CE). Although the explicit instruction was able to improve students' conceptual understanding of electrical circuits considerably in the simulation environment, their understanding did not reach the level of the students in the combination environment. These results suggest that when teaching students about electricity, the students can gain better understanding when they have an opportunity to use the simulation and the real circuits in parallel than if they have only a computer simulation available, even when the use of the simulation is supported with the explicit instruction. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Implementation of context-based chemistry programmes began 20 years ago in an attempt to make the learning of chemistry meaningful for students. This paper reviews such programmes through empirical studies on six international courses, ChemCom (USA), Salters (UK), Industrial Science (Israel), Chemie im Kontext (Germany), Chemistry in Practice (The Netherlands) and PLON (The Netherlands). These studies are categorised through emergent characteristics of: relevance, interest/attitudes/motivation and deeper understanding. These characteristics can be found to an extent in a number of other curricular initiatives, such as science-technology-society approaches and problem-based learning or project-based science, the latter of which often incorporates an inquiry-based approach to science education. These initiatives in science education are also considered with a focus on the characteristics of these approaches that are emphasised in context-based education. While such curricular studies provide a starting point for discussing context-based approaches in chemistry, to advance our understanding of how students connect canonical science concepts with the real-world context, a new theoretical framework is required. A dialectical sociocultural framework originating in the work of Vygotsky is used as a referent for analysing the complex human interactions that occur in context-based classrooms, providing teachers with recent information about the pedagogical structures and resources that afford students the agency to learn. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Review","Scopus"

Furthermore, tests of the effects of varying magnitudes of NOS knowledge on domain-specific science understanding and belief require the application of instruments validated in accordance with AERA, APA, and NCME assessment standards. Our study explores three interrelated aspects of a recently developed NOS instrument: (1) validity and reliability; (2) instrument dimensionality; and (3) item scales, properties, and qualities within the context of Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory (Rasch modeling). A construct analysis revealed that the instrument did not match published operationalizations of NOS concepts. Rasch analysis of the original instrument-as well as a reduced item set-indicated that a two-dimensional Rasch model fit significantly better than a one-dimensional model in both cases. Thus, our study revealed that NOS and SI are supported as two separate dimensions, corroborating theoretical distinctions in the literature. To identify items with unacceptable fit values, item quality analyses were used. A Wright Map revealed that few items sufficiently distinguished high performers in the sample and excessive numbers of items were present at the low end of the performance scale. Overall, our study outlines an approach for how Rasch modeling may be used to evaluate and improve Likert-type instruments in science education. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

It is even more challenging to learn to teach through methods that engage young students in building and using explanatory models. In part, this is because to do so requires that teachers make real-time instructional decisions in response to the ideas that students articulate. In this paper I present an example of a teacher who participated in a series of activities during a professional development course that guided her and her colleagues through the process of developing and revising an explanatory model of magnetic phenomenon. She subsequently transformed this series of activities to use with her elementary school students. Contrasting the series of activities in the elementary classroom to the corresponding professional development activities revealed improvisational instructional acts and shed light on aspects of the classroom context that necessitated and facilitated improvisation. In particular, this paper highlights the multiple pedagogical and disciplinary structures that teachers implicitly chose among when improvising. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Using quantitative methods, we investigated preservice teachers' curriculum design decision-making and how their decisions influenced the inquiry orientations of their planned science lessons. Findings indicate that preservice elementary teachers were able to accurately assess how inquiry-based existing curriculum materials are and to adapt them to make them more inquiry-based.

It addresses the question of whether elementary school students can deal with complex systems. The sample included 40 4th grade students from one school in a small town in Israel. The students studied an inquiry-based earth systems curriculum that focuses on the hydro-cycle. The program involved lab simulations and experiments, direct interaction with components and processes of the water cycle in the outdoor learning environment and knowledge integration activities. Despite the students' minimal initial system thinking abilities, most of them made significant progress with their ability to analyze the hydrological earth system to its components and processes. As a result, they recognized interconnections between components of a system. Some of the students reached higher system thinking abilities, such as identifying interrelationships among several earth systems and identifying hidden parts of the hydrological system. The direct contact with real phenomena and processes in small scale scenarios enabled these students to create a concrete local water cycle, which could later be expanded into large scale abstract global cycles. The incorporation of outdoor inquiry-based learning with lab inquiry-based activities and knowledge integration assignments contributed to the 4th grade students' capacity to develop basic system thinking abilities at their young age. This suggests that although system thinking is regarded as a high order thinking skill, it can be developed to a certain extent in elementary school.

The participants for this study included four faculty instructors and two purposively selected student groups, totaling eight students. We found the instructors' two course goals, (a) teaching students how scientists do science and (b) using an interdisciplinary approach to develop students' content knowledge of the big ideas in science, were consistent with our observations and the students' descriptions of their experience in the course. However, we observed, and the students also noted, an important feature of the course that the instructors did not describe as a course goal was its reliance on the social nature of learning.

By making and executing models of dynamic systems in a computer environment, students are stimulated to learn about the specific domain that is modeled as well as about the process of modeling in general. However, learning by modeling also leads to characteristic student mistakes, based on a combination of faulty domain knowledge and insufficient modeling skills. In this article, we describe a method of generating advice to students during their modeling process. The on-line advice system was informed by our observations of a teacher who gave advice via a textual communication tool to students building models with a System Dynamics model editor. The first version of the on-line advice system was evaluated in two ways: first, three teachers evaluated the advice the system generated for students' final solutions; second, we analyzed the advice the system provided as it was used by a sample of students who were building a physics model. These evaluations showed that the overall approach, including matching a student solution to a family of reference solutions together with the other mechanisms of the advice system, is valid. However, they also highlighted the difficulty of building 'intelligent' support to help students to improve their models and gain modeling expertise. The article concludes with a discussion of our current efforts to improve the advice system based on the lessons learnt, which suggest extension of the range of solution representations and of the operations of the advice method. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, elementary teachers, particularly beginning teachers, must often overcome a variety of challenges to engage their students in reform-minded, standardsbased, inquiry-oriented classroom practice. To better support beginning elementary teachers' learning to support students to ask and answer scientifically oriented questions, it is necessary to better understand their beliefs about questions and questioning, as well as how they negotiate these beliefs at this crucial stage of the teacher professional continuum. Four beginning elementary teachers were studied longitudinally over their first 3 years of professional teaching careers. Results show that each teacher cited the importance of driving questions and investigation questions to establish purpose and promote student sense-making. However, they followed different trajectories in reconciling their ideas about the use of driving questions and investigation questions in light of the particular facets of science teaching they prioritized.

The narratives show that constraints related to cultural, material, and social resources contributed to a more global symbolic resource constraint, the low status and priority of science in the school. The narratives develop a new category of strategic resources embodied or controlled by others and leveraged to improve students' opportunities to learn science. Attention to a broader array of resources, including social, symbolic, and strategic resources, helps to excavate some of the inertial forces that might derail efforts to teach for social justice.

Teachers' questioning is examined in light of their social understandings (i.e., how teachers understand social aspects of oral questioning in inquiry-based science classrooms). The reported findings show that, as a result of developing an increased awareness of social aspects of teacher questioning during the institute, teachers' referential questions (oral queries aimed at encouraging students to articulate their own ideas, understandings, experiences and personal opinions) were twice as frequent after the institute as they were before, hence suggesting an increased degree of student-centeredness. Furthermore, their student-centered questions prompted longer and more articulated student responses, promoted higherlevel student thinking, positioned students as complementary experts, prompted students to provide tentative responses, and encouraged students to conduct authentic investigations. Based on these findings, it is argued that educators who set out to prepare teachers to become effective questioners in the context of science inquiry discussions ought to go beyond cognitive issues and the simple provision of static and ill-defined labels such as ""guide"" and ""active inquirer."" © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The research question for the project was addressed by developing a conceptual framework that clarifies and specifies what is meant by ""inquiry-based science instruction,"" and by using a mixed-methodology approach to analyze both numerical and text data describing the impact of instruction on K-12 student science conceptual learning. Various findings across 138 analyzed studies indicate a clear, positive trend favoring inquiry-based instructional practices, particularly instruction that emphasizes student active thinking and drawing conclusions from data. Teaching strategies that actively engage students in the learning process through scientific investigations are more likely to increase conceptual understanding than are strategies that rely on more passive techniques, which are often necessary in the current standardized-assessment laden educational environment. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Here we argue that it is important that students and the public understand the basis on which scientists make scientific claims. The inquiry sought to develop an understanding of the scientific mind, explored through Gauld's (2005) notion of 'habits of mind'. The vehicle used to explore these ideas consisted of an inquiry into how scientists rationalise conflicts between scientific theories and religious beliefs which are not in agreement with consensually-accepted scientific theories. Twenty scientists from different scientific disciplines and levels of seniority were interviewed using as a basis an instrument containing a series of religious-based item statements that a panel of scientific and religious experts considered were in agreement with a variety of religious doctrines yet in disagreement with current scientific thinking, or for which there is at present no supporting evidence from a variety of scientific disciplines. These statements acted as an interview protocol and formed the basis for interactive discourse, which was audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and participant-validated. These data provide a window into scientific thinking as practiced by modern scientists, and helps develop a picture of these scientists' 'habits of mind'. The findings suggest that these scientists, unlike their stereotype, hold idiosyncratic views of what constitutes good scientific evidence and sound, credible testimony. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Data consisted of semi-structured interviews about actual inquiry units used by the teachers. These were used to situate the discussion of their teaching in a real context. The theoretical background is socio-cultural and pragmatist views on the role of language in science learning. The analysis focuses on two concepts of scientific inquiry: hypothesis and experiment. It is shown that the teachers tend to use these terms with a pedagogical function thus conflating methods of teaching with methods of inquiry as part of an emphasis on teaching the children the correct explanation.

In this article, we report on a multiple case study focusing on the possibilities and limitations of collaborative inquiry activities as an appropriate context to acquire Web literacy skills in primary education. Four 5th grade school teachers and their students worked with collaborative inquiry activities on the subject of 'healthy food'. The project was aimed at both the development of Web literacy skills and content knowledge building. Data from a variety of sources were collected: videotaped and written lesson observations, interviews with teachers and students, teacher diaries, student questionnaires, and student assignments. The teachers appeared to be able to carry out the program to varying degrees. Contextual factors that influenced the realization of the project's goals and results were the adequacy of the research questions formulated by students, students' inquiry skills, and the teachers' teaching styles. Students' learning results show that it is possible to teach Web literacy skills in the context of collaborative inquiry activities. All classes show knowledge gain with regard to the subject healthy food and all classes but one show knowledge gain with regard to Web literacy skills. Although many students show adequate use of particular Web searching, reading and evaluating skills after the project, inconsistency, impulsiveness and impatience are also typical of their Web behaviour. In the context of collaborative inquiry activities teachers are challenged to deal with the paradox that they want their students to be active knowledge builders with help of the Web, whereas the Web seems to invite students to be more or less passive searchers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Much of the existing learner modeling research work focuses on identifying appropriate learner properties. Little attention, however, has been given to leverage Dynamic Decision Network (DDN) as a dynamic learner model to reason and intervene across time. Employing a DDN-based learner model in a scientific inquiry learning environment, however, remains at infant stage because there are factors contributed to the performance the learner model. Three factors have been identified to influence the matching accuracy of INQPRO's learner model. These factors are the structure of DDN model, the variable instantiation approach, and the weights assignment method for two consecutive Decision Networks (DNs). In this research work, a two-phase empirical study involving 107 learners and six domain experts was conducted to determine the optimal conditions for the INQPRO's dynamic learner model. The empirical results suggested each time-slice of the INQPRO's DDN should consist of a DN, and that DN should correspond to the Graphical User Interface (GUI) accessed. In light of evidence, observable variables should be instantiated to their observed states; leaving the remaining observable nodes uninstantiated.

The evaluation focused on three levels: a micro level, concerned with issues of usability; a meso level, which examined educational effectiveness in terms of learning breakthroughs and breakdowns; and a macro level, which looked at the impact of the new technology on school museum visits practice. Issues of implementing mobile learning across school and museum settings are identified and cross-level influences are discussed. The study showed that the service was effective in enabling students to gather information in a museum and this provided resources for effective construction and reflection in the classroom. Minor usability problems did not detract from the learning, however there are significant issues concerning how to structure the visit and on the viability of Myartspace as a regular service. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It appeared that the curriculum documents and the standardized examinations mostly emphasized student understanding of fundamental principles and concepts of physics. Moreover, the two examinations consistently over-represented the curriculum at both application and analysis cognitive levels. The study also indicated that neither the organization of the current curriculum guidelines nor the exit assessments encourage creativity, critical thinking, and the development of students' abilities to conduct scientific inquiry.

MSK is a subcomponent of metacognition defined as general, explicit knowledge about thinking strategies. Following earlier studies that showed considerable effects of explicit instruction of MSK regarding the strategy of variables control, the present study explores whether similar effects are found in two additional scientific thinking strategies: Define Research Questions and Formulate Research Hypotheses. Participants were 119 eighth-grade students from six classes of a heterogeneous school. Equal numbers of low-achieving and high-achieving students were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. The findings showed dramatic developments in students' performance following instruction. The effect of the treatment was preserved in a delayed transfer test. Our findings show that explicit teaching of MSK had a stronger effect for low-achieving students than for high-achieving students.

Ultimately, the study provided an example of the effective introduction of a reform pedagogical approach in a large class setting. In the narrative, the strengths of HLM as a statistical technique are discussed in the context of pedagogical reforms, and the case is made for the use of HLM in rigorous determinations of both effectiveness and equity associated with reform practices. The implementation of PLGI in a college-level general chemistry course is also described. For the study, two general HLM models suited to investigating reform were developed and utilized to examine the effectiveness and equity of PLGI as implemented in this setting. The models showed that the reform was associated with statistically significant improvement over traditional pedagogy in terms of academic performance on multiple measures, but achieving equity remained elusive: the consequences of pre-existing achievement gaps did not lessen as a result of reform implementation.

An online test and the flow-map technique were employed to probe concept achievements that indicated the learning outcome. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, correlation and regression analyses were conducted to present trends and relations among variables. It was found that participants of the study who mostly had not developed sophisticated epistemological beliefs displayed only moderate preferences toward explorative and interactive web-based learning environments, and they seemed to be conservative about the effectiveness of the new type of learning.

This paper reports on several iterative cycles of design-based research aimed at fostering preservice teachers' principled reasoning around these problems of practice through modeling-centered scientific inquiry. The first design cycle introduced preservice teachers to modeling and simulation software tools in an effort to advance their understanding of science and technology; the second used an instructional framework embodying modeling-centered inquiry to advance their views of effective science teaching and their lesson-planning practices; the third engaged preservice teachers in analyzing and modifying curriculum materials using reform-based criteria to foster effective curriculum materials use. Outcomes from these iterations indicate that the preservice teachers were most likely to advance their knowledge and practices within a coherent approach that focused on a core scientific practice such as modeling-centered inquiry, provided opportunities to unpack and apply robust tools such as reform-based instructional frameworks, and addressed their perceived problems of practice.

Students' challenges were mainly linked to the comprehension of complex, multi-stage, biotechnological processes and methods that are abundant throughout the curriculum and required the use of previous knowledge in new contexts. A complex interaction of factors, namely teachers' PCK, the APL genre, and the biotechnology content of the curriculum, shaped the instructional strategies of the new curriculum and the outcomes of its enactment.","Article","Scopus"

The themes gender equity, questioning level, science vocabulary load, and readability level provided the conceptual framework for the analyses. An unobtrusive research method, content analysis, was used by coding the manifest content and counting the frequency of words, photographs, drawings, and questions by cognitive level. The context was an undergraduate chemistry teacher preparation program at a large public university in a metropolitan area in northwestern Turkey. Forty preservice chemistry teachers were guided to analyze 10 middle school science and 10 high school chemistry textbooks. Overall, the textbooks included unfair gender representations, a considerably higher number of input and processing than output level questions, and high load of science terminology. The textbooks failed to provide sufficient empirical evidence to be considered as gender equitable and inquiry-based. The quantitative approach employed for evaluation contrasts with a more interpretive approach, and has the potential in depicting textbook profiles in a more reliable way, complementing the commonly employed qualitative procedures. Implications suggest that further work in this line is needed on calibrating the analysis procedures with science textbooks used in different international settings. The procedures could be modified and improved to meet specific evaluation needs. In the Turkish context, next step research may concern the analysis of science textbooks being rewritten for the reform-based curricula to make cross-comparisons and evaluate a possible progression. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Findings reported in this paper are from one and a half-year design research for science learning in one primary school in Singapore. In this study, we closely examined the design and enactment of the Knowledge Building Community model in one class with high-achieving students and two classes with mixed-ability students. The research consists of two phases: Phase I Cultivating a collaborative knowledge building culture and Phase II Progressive Knowledge Building using Knowledge Forum. Data were collected from multiple sources, including knowledge assessment, conceptual understanding tasks, and the content analysis of Knowledge Forum postings. The results in Phase I show that while it is critical for students to monitor and build knowledge for their own understanding, they had difficulties developing such skills. In both phases, we found positive impacts on academic achievements showing improvement of student understanding in the course of reflective thinking and progressive inquiry. Overall, quantitative data suggest that the collaborative knowledge building environment was beneficial for both high-achieving and low-achieving students.

According to a procedural model, which is described in the text, this phase begins with an observation that stimulates students' prior factual knowledge, the formulation of a research question for further elaboration (epistemic questions), the anticipation of a hypothetical answer, and the planning of experimental steps for deciding on the hypothetical answer. These activities were explicitly prescribed in an experimental group of 28 10th-graders. Raising the quality of students' epistemic research questions by providing structured help was a special focus of the intervention. Hypothesised motivational and cognitive effects were measured and compared with a group of 25 students (control group) who engaged in non-structured pre-experimental activities. The intervention provided to the experimental group resulted in stronger preferences for a more open and non-recipe type of experimentation, in more intense cognitive activities (thoughts), and, most importantly, in increased skills for formulating causal epistemic questions. Supporting such procedural skills in classrooms may contribute to transforming labwork into intentional activities and students into active learners by helping them focus on further elaborating their knowledge.","Article","Scopus"

Using a novice-expert analysis, my research team specified atmospheric scientists' modelling practices as learning objectives, designed a dynamic modelling tool in light of the knowledge bases of scientists and students, provided students with dynamic simulations to help them visualise complex processes, and designed learning activities to encourage model-based reasoning. One teacher and 29 10th-graders participated in an implementation study that examined students' conceptual understandings and modelling practices in APoME. The results show that students' understandings about air quality were significantly improved after they engaged in the APoME activities. Students designed plans with detailed procedures, identified more major variables relevant to air pollutant dispersion, carefully controlled and manipulated variables to test their model, and provided multiple ways for data collection.

Through the use of semistructured interviews, the perceptions of 37 scientists from diverse science domains and 21 middle and high school science teachers were explored. Participating scientists expressed concerns about the variability in quality of teaching, programs, and resources available for science instruction. Scientists expressed a desire for teachers to have more experience conducting science research and developing their own critical thinking skills. When asked what goals are most important for science education, 40% of the scientists emphasized that teachers should make science fun and exciting for their students. Science teachers' perceptions of science education were compared with the scientists' perceptions. Thirty percent of the teachers agreed with the scientists that too much variability in program or instructional quality exists in science education. Seventy-six percent of the science teachers also thought there is a need to teach critical thinking skills, but more importantly there is a need to inspire creativity and a desire to learn science in students.

In this study eight sets of high school biology curriculum materials were reviewed to determine their potential for promoting teacher learning. Design heuristics for educative curriculum materials were adapted for use as evaluation criteria. From this analysis, several themes emerged. First, the materials tended to provide support for teachers' subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge for students' ideas (e.g., misconceptions) but rarely for their pedagogical content knowledge of scientific inquiry. Second, the materials contained several implementation guidance supports but far fewer rationales for instructional decisions, which are an important feature of educative curriculum materials. Finally, the quality of support varied widely, differing in its degree of relevance, pedagogical helpfulness, and depth.

Participants included 6 teachers and 568 students. Videotapes, teacher questionnaires, and student pre- and posttests were analyzed to develop case studies that characterized the support the teachers provided their students for scientific argumentation and subsequent student learning. Patterns from the case studies suggest that one particular instructional practice, the way teachers defined scientific argumentation, characterized teachers' support and influenced the other practices they used in their classrooms. In some cases, the teachers' definitions of scientific argumentation did not align with the intended learning goal in the curriculum materials.

Middle-level students interacted with the Moon through observations, sketching, journalling, two-dimensional and three-dimensional modelling, and classroom discussions. These lunar lessons were adapted from the Realistic Explorations in Astronomical Learning (REAL) curriculum. Students' conceptual understandings were measured through analysis of pre-test and post-test results on a Lunar Phases Concept Inventory (LPCI) and a Geometric Spatial Assessment (GSA). The LPCI was used to assess conceptual learning of eight science and four mathematics domains. The GSA was used to assess learning of the same four mathematical domains; however, the GSA test items were not posed within a lunar context. Results showed both male and female groups to make significant gains in understanding on the overall LPCI test scores as well as significant gains on five of the eight science domains and on three of the four mathematics domains. The males scored significantly higher than the females on the science domain, phase-Sun/Earth/Moon positions, and on the mathematics domain geometric spatial visualisation. GSA results found both male and female groups achieving a significant increase in their test scores on the overall GSA. Females made significant gains on the GSA mathematics domains, periodic patterns and cardinal directions, while males made significant gains on only the periodic patterns domain.

We evaluated the quantity of the interactions by looking at quantitative data of the discussion 'threads' and we evaluated the quality of the discussion by content analysis of the individual messages. Both the procedural facilitation of the discussion and the instrument for content analysis were based on Garrison's 'Practical Inquiry model of Cognitive Presence'. Furthermore, we explored the experiences of the students and moderators by interviewing them and we organised their perceptions using the framework of an activity system. On the basis of the quantitative and qualitative data we conclude that the e-learning model was successful in establishing a dialogue among a group of students and an expert during work placements at different locations. The 'Practical Inquiry model' was useful in facilitating a sustained on-topic discourse involving critical thinking.

However, there is also evidence that such responses underpredict the more sophisticated knowledge that teachers may use in classroom situations. The purpose of this study was to characterize the informal ideas used by teachers in situations directly relevant to their teaching of science. The sample comprised 50 Mexican primary school teachers. Three areas of informal expertise were addressed: scientists and their work; scientific inquiry; and data measurement. The teachers' thinking was explored through questionnaires and semistructured interviews using pedagogically relevant contexts. The database was analyzed first to describe ideas shared by teachers and second to identify any recurrent themes and patterns among responses. Teachers' responses were characterized around four areas of discourse: demarcation of science; scientific procedures; approaches to reliable knowledge; and professional and institutional features of science. The teachers' responses were diverse in their contextualization, that is, they incorporated specific background and contextual details to a different extent. Most responses showed limited or intermediate contextualization across all four areas of discourse, though some more sophisticated responses were noted.

The process was guided by two questions: to what extent did course re-conceptualization efforts lead to a more informed understanding of formative assessment by pre-service teachers and did strategies enacted in the re-conceptualized methods course foster or hinder pre-service teachers' understanding of formative assessment? Data from this study support the following findings: (1) a substantial pre- to postmethods course difference was realized in the pre-service teachers' understanding of formative assessment; (2) explicit and contextualized approaches to formative assessment in the methods course led to increased understandings by preservice teachers; (3) an implicit approach led to improvements in course structure but did not foster pre-service teachers' understanding of the reflexive nature of formative assessment; and (4) a field-based case study on elementary science teaching both hindered and fostered our efforts with formative assessment. This study yields implications for pre-service teacher education on formative assessment. To foster pre-service teachers' knowledge and skills, we suggest explicit instruction on formative assessment combined with case studies, field experiences, and ongoing reflection. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The main focus of the paper lies on the effectiveness of different teaching methods in promoting systems thinking in the field of Education for Sustainable Development. The following methods were incorporated into the study: special lessons designed to promote systems thinking, a computer-simulated scenario on the topic ""ecosystem forest,"" and a combination of both special lessons and the computer simulation. These groups were then compared to a control group. A questionnaire was used to assess systems thinking skills of 424 sixth-grade students of secondary schools in Germany. The assessment differentiated between a conceptual understanding (measured as achievement score) and a reflexive justification (measured as justification score) of systems thinking. The following control variables were used: logical thinking, grades in school, memory span, and motivational goal orientation. Based on the pretest-posttest control group design, only those students who received both special instruction and worked with the computer simulation showed a significant increase in their achievement scores. The justification score increased in the computer simulation condition as well as in the combination of computer simulation and lesson condition. The possibilities and limits of promoting various forms of systems thinking by using realistic computer simulations are discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Article","Scopus"

Four classes of students, aged 12-14 years from two countries, were asked to discuss which of two graphs best represented the change in temperature as ice was heated to steam. The discussion was initiated by asking questions about the phenomenon. Working in groups (with members who had differing viewpoints) and guided by a set of question prompts, an argument sheet, and an argument diagram, students discussed contrasting arguments. One group of students from each class was audiotaped. The number of questions written, the concepts addressed, and the quality of written arguments were then scored. A positive correlation between these factors was found. Discourse analysis showed that the initial focus on questions prompted students to articulate their puzzlement; make explicit their claims and (mis) conceptions; identify and relate relevant key concepts; construct explanations; and consider alternative propositions when their ideas were challenged. Productive argumentation was characterized by students' questions which focused on key ideas of inquiry, a variety of scientific concepts, and which made explicit reference to the structural components of an argument. These findings suggest that supporting students in productive discourse is aided by scaffolding student questioning, teaching the criteria for a good argument, and providing a structure that helps them to organize and verbalize their arguments. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Driver, P. Newton, & J. Osborne, 2000). In this paper, we identify three goals of engaging in these related scientific practices: (1) sensemaking, (2) articulating, and (3) persuading. We propose using these goals to understand student engagement with these practices, and to design instructional interventions to support students. Thus, we use this framework as a lens to investigate the question: What successes and challenges do students face as they engage in the scientific practices of explanation and argumentation? We study this in the context of a curriculum that provides students and teachers with an instructional framework for constructing and defending scientific explanations. Through this analysis, we find that students consistently use evidence to make sense of phenomenon and articulate those understandings but they do not consistently attend to the third goal of persuading others of their understandings. Examining the third goal more closely reveals that persuading others of an understanding requires social interactions that are often inhibited by traditional classroom interactions. Thus, we conclude by proposing design strategies for addressing the social challenges inherent in the related scientific practices of explanation and argumentation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The instruction for both groups included a week long, laboratory-based, forensics unit. Students were given pre-, post-, and delayed posttests, the results of which were analyzed through a Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) using students' scores, teacher, level of school, Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol (RTOP) scores, and school socioeconomic status. Overall, compared to students in traditional sections, students who participated in an inquiry-based laboratory unit showed significantly higher posttest scores; had the higher scores, more growth, and long-term retention at both the high school and middle school levels, if their teacher had stronger implementation of inquiry methods (as measured by RTOP scores); and tended to have better outcomes than those who learned through traditional methods, regardless of level of poverty in the school.

Holding rich high school scientific discussions is challenging, especially when the demands of content and norms of high school science pose challenges to their enactment. There is little research on how high school teachers enact scientific discussions using project-based science curricula, making the kinds of necessary embedded supports unclear. To address that gap in the research literature, this study analyzed curriculum supports and embedded educative features for the enactment of science discussions in one high school project-based science curriculum. Through a study of teacher enactment and a comparison of the curriculum discussion supports, we observed that while teachers increased their attempts to engage in inquiry-based discussion practices where supports were offered, they relied on heavily on traditional ""recitation"" formats, demonstrating that existing curricular supports were not developed enough to support dialogic classroom interactions. We hypothesize about conditions that may contribute to the pervasiveness of typical discourse practices in high school science discussions. We argue for expanded curricular discussion supports for teachers and design research on developing discussions in high school project-based science classrooms to examine how such supports are taken up, dismissed, or modified in practice. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The elements of NOS and scientific inquiry identified in the scientific research on SARS were explicitly emphasized in our instructional materials. The contemporary real-life context of SARS was found to be effective in promoting student-teachers' understanding of NOS and scientific inquiry, particularly in terms of: the realization of inseparable links between science and the social, cultural, and political environment; deeper understanding of how science and technology impact on each other; and a richer appreciation of the processes of authentic scientific inquiry and the humanistic character of scientists.

Theoretical ideas, evidence and the material world are entities internal to scientific inquiry and, in educational contexts, connections between them are considered essential in assisting the development of young children's scientific thinking. The results indicated that in the early-years science classroom scientific activity was mainly confined to the representational level. Intervention practices into the material world were limited, and were based on collected evidence. No interventions based on ideas were identified in the science lessons.

A multiple case study approach was taken, utilising qualitative research methods of unobtrusive observation, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The findings showed purposeful and focused learning occurring, but students were acquiring a narrow view of scientific inquiry where the thinking was characteristically rote and low-level. The nature of this learning was strongly influenced by curriculum decisions made by classroom teachers and science departments in response to the assessment requirements of a high stakes national qualification. As a consequence of these decisions, students experienced structured teaching programmes in which they were exposed to programme content that limited the range of methods that scientists use to fair testing and to pedagogies that were substantially didactic in nature. In addition, the use of planning templates and exemplar assessment schedules tended to reduce student learning about experimental design to an exercise in ""following the rules"" as they engaged in closed rather than open investigations. Thus, the resulting student learning was mechanistic and superficial rather than creative and critical, counter to the aims of the national curriculum policy that is intent on promoting students' knowledge and capabilities in authentic scientific inquiry.","Article","Scopus"

We provided professional development to bolster urban teachers' science content knowledge (CK) and science pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) to observe the maximal impact of the PBS curriculum. We found that students' science achievement improved with the PBS curriculum, but that their attitudes toward science and plans to pursue science did not. Increases in teachers' CK and PCK with the professional development correlated with the improvements in student science achievement but did not correlate with improvements in student science attitudes or plans. However, the frequency of teachers' use of specific inquiry-based activities did correlate with improvements in students' science attitudes and plans.

We examine the effects of a multifaceted scaling reform that focuses on supporting standards based science teaching in urban middle schools. The effort was one component of a systemic reform effort in the Detroit Public Schools, and was centered on highly specified and developed project-based inquiry science units supported by aligned professional development and learning technologies. Two cohorts of 7th and 8th graders that participated in the project units are compared with the remainder of the district population, using results from the highstakes state standardized test in science. Both the initial and scaled up cohorts show increases in science content understanding and process skills over their peers, and significantly higher pass rates on the statewide test. The relative gains occur up to a year and a half after participation in the curriculum, and show little attenuation with in the second cohort when scaling occurred and the number of teachers involved increased. The effect of participation in units at different grade levels is independent and cumulative, with higher levels of participation associated with similarly higher achievement scores. Examination of results by gender reveals that the curriculum effort succeeds in reducing the gender gap in achievement experienced by urban African-American boys. These findings demonstrate that standards-based, inquiry science curriculum can lead to standardized achievement test gains in historically underserved urban students, when the curriculum is highly specified, developed, and aligned with professional development and administrative support. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

As commonly implemented in venues ranging from middle school classrooms to undergraduate laboratories, it emphasizes the testing of predictions rather than ideas, focuses learners on material activity at the expense of deep subject matter understanding, and lacks epistemic framing relevant to the discipline. While critiques of the scientific method are not new, its cumulative effects on learners' conceptions of science have not been clearly articulated. We discuss these effects using findings from a series of five studies with degree-holding graduates of our educational system who were preparing to enter the teaching profession and apprentice their own young learners into unproblematic images of how science is done. We then offer an alternative vision for investigative science - model-based inquiry (MBI) - as a system of activity and discourse that engages learners more deeply with content and embodies five epistemic characteristics of scientific knowledge: that ideas represented in the form of models are testable, revisable, explanatory, conjectural, and generative. We represent MBI as an interconnected set of classroom conversations and provide examples of its implementation and its limitations. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

We propose an approach to systematically analyzing and scoring the quality of students' explanations based on three components: claim, evidence to support it and a reasoning that justifies the link between the claim and the evidence. We collected students' science notebooks from eight science inquiry-based middle-school classrooms in five states. All classrooms implemented the same scientific-inquiry based curriculum. The study focuses on one of the implemented investigations and the students' explanations that resulted from it. Nine students' notebooks were selected within each classroom. Therefore, a total of 72 students' notebooks were analyzed and scored using the proposed approach. Quality of students' explanations was linked with students' performance in different types of assessments administered as the end-of-unit test: multiple-choice test, predict-observe-explain, performance assessment, and a short open-ended question. Results indicated that: (a) Students' written explanations can be reliably scored with the proposed approach. (b) Constructing explanations were not widely implemented in the classrooms studied despite its significance in the context of inquiry-based science instruction. (c) Overall, a low percentage of students (18%) provided explanations with the three expected components. The majority of the sample (40%) provided only claims without any supporting data or reasoning. And (d) the magnitude of the correlations between students' quality of explanations and their performance, were all positive but varied in magnitude according to the type of assessment. We concluded that engaging students in the construction of high quality explanations may be related to higher levels of student performance. The opportunities to construct explanations in science-inquiry based classrooms, however, seem to be limited. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Dynamic inquiry learning is characterized by the following criteria: learning as a process, changes during the inquiry, procedural understanding, and affective points of view. This study compared the influence of open versus guided inquiry learning approaches on dynamic inquiry performances among high-school biology students. We hypothesized that open inquiry students who engage in the inquiry process from its initial stage, participating in the decision making process of asking inquiry questions and planning all aspects of the inquiry, will outperform students who experienced guided inquiry, in terms of developing dynamic inquiry performances. Students were divided into two groups: guided and open inquiry learning approaches. Both groups were followed throughout their 2-year inquiry learning process. The data sources included interviews, students' inquiry summary papers, logbooks, and reflections. A quantitative content analysis of the two groups, using a dynamic inquiry performances index, revealed that open inquiry students used significantly higher levels of performances in the criteria ""changes during inquiry"" and ""procedural understanding.""

This article reports on the results of two experiments that investigate how hypermedia using a conceptual representation influences pre-service teachers' and middle school students' learning of a complex biological system, the human respiratory system. We designed two versions of instructional hypermedia based on the structure-behavior-function conceptual representation. One hypermedia was function-centered which emphasized the function and behavior of the system, whereas the other was focused on the structure of the system. We contrasted the instructional effectiveness of these two alternative conceptual representations. The results of both studies indicated that participants using the function-centered hypermedia developed deeper understanding than those using the structure-centered version.

As intuitively pleasing as these programs are, scant evidence documents their effectiveness. For this study, four secondary science teachers were followed back to their classrooms following a 6-week, marine ecology RET. The research employed qualitative and quantitative data collection to answer these questions: What were the teachers' initial conceptions and enactment of classroom inquiry, and howdid they change after the RET?; How did changes in the nature and use of questions highlight changes in inquiry enactment?; and How were the teachers' changes linked to the RET and are there changes that cannot be explained by the RET experience?

The researchers utilized qualitative procedures to analyze students' views on the nature of science as expressed through their answers to online and interview questions, and to examine features of argumentation and discourse in the final classroom debate. The students' answers to questions related to the nature of science reflected conceptions of the tentative, creative, subjective, and social aspects of science. Yet aspects of the nature of science did not enter into the debate discussions. Instead students utilized more factual-based content of the evidence that ultimately led into numerous instances of fallacious reasoning and personal attacks.

This study was embedded in a larger theoretical framework of investigating earth systems science through the understanding of nature-knowledge-culture systems from local, place-based perspectives. Specifically, we were interested in learning more about eco-justice issues that are related to environmental degradation in Malawi and the potential role of inquiry-oriented pedagogies in addressing these issues. In a science methods course, the African educators' views on deforestation and teaching about ecological sustainability were explored within the context of the local environment and culture. Teachers participated in inquiry pedagogies designed to promote the sharing of perspectives related to the connections between culture and ecological degradation. Strategies encouraging dialogue and reflection included role-playing, class discussions, curriculum development activities, teaching experiences with children, and field trips to a nature preserve. Data were analyzed from postcolonial and critical pedagogy of place theoretical perspectives to better understand the hybridization of viewpoints influenced by both Western and indigenous science and the political hegemonies that impact sustainable living in Malawi. Findings suggested that the colonial legacy of Malawi continues to impact the ecological sustainability issue of deforestation. Inquiry-oriented pedagogies and connections to indigenous science were embraced by the Malawian educators as a means to involve children in investigation, decision making, and ownership of critical environmental issues. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Review","Scopus"

We present a model for examining these practices based on three components of formative assessment (eliciting, recognizing, and using information) and the three domains linked to scientific inquiry (epistemic frameworks, conceptual structures, and social processes). We describe the informal assessment practices as ESRU cycles - the teacher Elicits a question; the Student responds; the teacher Recognizes the student's response; and then Uses the information collected to support student learning. By tracking the strategies teachers used in terms of ESRU cycles, we were able to capture differences in assessment practices across the three teachers during the implementation of four investigations of a physical science unit on buoyancy. Furthermore, based on information collected in a three-question embedded assessment administered to assess students' learning, we linked students' level of performance to the teachers' informal assessment practices. We found that the teacher who more frequently used complete ESRU cycles had students with higher performance on the embedded assessment as compared with the other two teachers. We conclude that the ESRU model is a useful way of capturing differences in teachers' informal assessment practices.

The science-learning task which implicitly modelled design principles for science instruction in school contexts was derived from kitchen chemistry where the students investigated in small groups the nature of five solid samples of different cooking ingredients. The instructional goal of the learning situation was to develop the students' conceptions of solubility, the activity itself involved collaborative inquiry and experimentation. The study follows a three-step research design: pre-test, intervention and post-test, in order to highlight the students' explanations around the concept of solubility and their elaboration in social activity. A specific discourse analysis method was developed for the study, to investigate the mechanisms of explanation-building in small-group discourse. The data for the study were collected by means of videotapes, direct observations, transcriptions and questionnaires clarifying the students' explanations for dissolving. The study introduces an analytic tool for untangling the processes of explanation-building in collaborative inquiry which takes a synchronous and diachronic approach to communicative and cognitive processes of student discourse. The analysis highlights the reciprocal relationship between the nature of explanations and the students' communicative processes in the evolving discourse. The data analysis shows that the negotiation processes around the concept of solubility consisted of diverse interpretations, varying from informal explanations to formal explanations, and from descriptive reasoning to causal reasoning. The results of the students' pre- and post-tests indicate that the social science-learning situation provided the students with opportunities to elaborate their explanations for dissolving, and reflecting practical, theoretical and applied understanding. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The findings suggested adequate coherences between teachers' SEVs and their teaching beliefs as well as instructional practices. The teachers with relatively positivist-aligned SEVs tended to draw attention to students' science scores in tests and allocate more instructional time on teacher-directed lectures, tutorial problem practices, or in-class examinations, implying a more passive or rote perspective about learning science. In contrast, teachers with constructivist-oriented SEVs tended to focus on student understanding and application of scientific concepts and they adopted more time on student inquiry activities or interactive discussion. These findings are quite consistent with the results about the coherence between teachers' SEVs and students' perceptions toward science learning environments, suggesting that the constructivist- oriented SEVs appeared to foster the creation of more constructivist-oriented science learning environments.

Ten teachers in Finland designed and implemented eight, inquiry-learning units ('designs') in 12 primary and secondary level classrooms in various subject domains. The guiding principles behind the designs were the objectives of progressive inquiry, such as facilitation of question- and explanation-driven learning, and the use of collaborative technology to support the sharing of knowledge. The participating teachers received substantial pedagogical training on these issues before the classroom implementations. The present study concentrated on examining three aspects in the teachers' pedagogical designs: solutions for supporting students' inquiry efforts, organization of collaboration, and the role given to the web-based Collaborative Learning Environment (CLE). The teachers experienced the use of CLE as a valuable new possibility to foster collaboration in classroom work, but there was much variation in the ways that the affordances of the system were utilized. The results indicated that it was a challenge for the teachers, especially in secondary level, to find appropriate methods for supporting students' inquiry efforts.

Ninety students from two secondary schools participated. Two versions of an external collaboration script (high vs. low structured) supporting collaborative argumentation were embedded within a Web-based collaborative inquiry learning environment. Students' internal scripts were classified as either high or low structured, establishing a 2 × 2-factorial design. Results suggest that the high structured external collaboration script supported the acquisition of domain-general knowledge of all learners regardless of their internal scripts. Learners' internal scripts influenced the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge.

The context in which the participants received instruction was in an inquiry-based physics course, and the targeted science content was the cause of moon phases. Qualitative research methods, including observations and interviews, were used to investigate and describe participants' conceptual understanding over time. Participants were interviewed on their understanding of the cause of moon phases before instruction, 3 weeks after instruction, and again in delayed post-interviews several months after instruction. Patterns and themes in the participants' conceptual understanding were identified through constant-comparative data analysis. Consistent with results reported earlier, participants who had instruction that included recording and analyzing moon observations over time and psychomotor modeling of changes in moon phases were very likely to hold a scientific conceptual understanding shortly after instruction. The present study indicates a majority of participants continued to hold a scientific understanding six months or more after instruction. However, some participants reverted to alternative conceptions they had shown during the pre-interview. These results are interpreted utilizing contemporary conceptual change theory. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

CILES consisted of six scales, sorted by two aspects. The first aspect, the cognitive-metacognitive aspect, included the scales of student negotiation, inquiry learning, and reflective thinking, whereas the second aspect, the content-technical aspect, involved the scales of Relevance, Ease of Use, and Challenge. A LISREL structural model was also proposed to examine the relationships between students' responses across these two aspects. Survey responses gathered from 483 high school students in Taiwan were the research data for this study. The results from the LISREL confirmatory analysis showed that CILES had highly satisfactory validity and reliability to assess students' preferences for constructivist Internet-based learning environments. Moreover, the structural model indicated that the Internet learning environments that challenged students' existing concepts could facilitate their preferences for student negotiation, inquiry learning and reflective thinking activities. It is proposed that the Internet can have rich connections with numerous resources and a variety of perspectives, thus constructing appropriate learning environments to provide different kinds of challenges for learners. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Although some students were familiar with the standard concepts of position, velocity, and acceleration from physics classes, most students had difficulty using these concepts to characterize actual or hypothetical motions. Furthermore, some students developed their own nonstandard method of describing accelerated motion in terms of changes in the average velocity, from the start of the motion up to a given time. This is in contrast to the physics community's use of the acceleration construct, defined in terms of changes in the instantaneous velocity, to describe such motion. Although the change in average velocity is not typically identified as an important construct in traditional physics texts, some students found it intuitively appealing, and were able to use it successfully to describe and predict motion. We conclude that by focusing on standard constructs, and ignoring possible intuitive ways that students might view motion, standard kinematics instruction may miss an opportunity to maximize student understanding. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Data sources included interviews, field notes, and artifacts, as these prospective teachers engaged in learning how to teach science. Research questions included 1) What were these prospective teachers' beliefs of teaching science? 2) To what extent did these prospective teachers articulate understandings of teaching science as inquiry? 3) In what ways, if any, did these prospective teachers endeavor to teach science as inquiry in their classrooms? 4) In what ways did the mentor teachers' views of teaching science appear to support or constrain these prospective teachers' intentions and abilities to teach science as inquiry? Despite support from a professional development school setting, the Interns' teaching strategies represented an entire spectrum of practice - from traditional, lecture-driven lessons, to innovative, open, full-inquiry projects. Evidence suggests one of the critical factors influencing a prospective teacher's intentions and abilities to teach science as inquiry, is the teacher's complex set of personal beliefs about teaching and of science.

Or is the opportunity to practice in a computer-supported simulation environment a sufficient condition to foster inquiry learning skills? In this study, two groups of sixth grade children were compared: a training group, and a practice group. The training group received an off-line inquiry learning training in which we focused on fostering strategies for proper inferencing and designing experiments. The practice group conducted four inquiry learning tasks during two practice sessions. Learning outcomes and inquiry learning process measures were collected to study whether training and practice resulted in desired changes in learning behaviour.

We examined, over 3 years, the practices and conceptions of two teachers involved in implementing student inquiry projects. Neither teacher was initially satisfied with her success at supporting student inquiry, but the two had very different responses to difficulties they faced. These responses related strongly to their ideas about how learning should be structured. There was less relation between their stated views about the nature of science and their use of inquiry than was expected. The teacher with espoused views about the nature of science generally in accord with reform documents did not support student inquiry projects that involved actual investigations. The teacher with views on the nature of science less aligned with reform documents worked hard to support student investigations in her classroom. Our findings support the claim that merely learning about the nature of science or about student inquiry may not generate changes in a teacher's practice. On closer analysis, we found that the two teachers understood aspects of the nature of science from two quite different perspectives, the proximal and the distal. The proximal view of the nature of science was more closely aligned with implementation of actual student investigations. The efforts of these two teachers in implementing inquiry illustrate the dilemmas and challenges they faced as they attempted student inquiry projects.","Article","Scopus"

Students engaged in both laboratory practices and seminars as part of their experience in this program. We assessed student learning about conceptual knowledge of molecular genetics as well as their beliefs about the nature of science. Student conceptual knowledge increased and their beliefs about the nature of science changed to a more tentative perspective. We examined student learning qualitatively through their journals, which showed that some students were developing more sophisticated ways of thinking about the issues that were raised in their seminars and laboratory research. These ways included an increased ability to generate hypotheses, consider alternative hypotheses, implement models and logical argumentation in explanations, connect ideas, extend concepts, and ask questions.

A new concept of simulation-based teaching with a built-in learning history is introduced in several simulation-based teaching tools. The user of these systems obtains access to past states and decisions and to the consequences of these decisions. To date, there has been very little research on the effectiveness and efficiency of the learning history in simulation-based teaching. In this paper we report the results of a controlled experiment to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a learning process that takes place in a dynamic simulation. This was done with and without recording and accessing the history of the learning process, along with the ability to restart the simulation from any point. The experiment was based on the simulation teaching tool called the Operations Trainer (OT) that simulates the order fulfillment process in a manufacturing organization, implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. The findings show that with the learning history recording and inquiry available to the users of the OT simulator, a better performance was obtained during the learning process itself. Moreover, when the use of the history mechanism was removed after 2weeks , the better performance still remained. In addition, performance was similarly better in a different context, than the one used in the original learning with access to the learning history. The findings are discussed with respect to the self-learning process in simulation-based teaching environments and the practical implications of using simulators in the growing field of Electronic Learning (E-Learning). ©2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Article","Scopus"

At the end of the unit on water quality, students were capable of fully participating in designing a more complicated inscription and interpreting new inscriptions. The findings suggest that four features of the learning environment promoted the development of inscriptional practices: (1) embedding the use of inscriptions in students' science inquiry; (2) providing scaffolds to support students' inquiry process; (3) sequencing tasks and the inquiry process; and (4) engaging students in science inquiry in an iterated manner.

The strategy was thought out, elaborated, and tested in classrooms in several research cycles. Throughout the field-tests, research data were collected by means of classroom observations, interviews, audio-taped discussions, completed worksheets, written tests, and questionnaires. Reflection on the research findings eventuated in reshaping and formalizing the learning and teaching strategy, which is presented here.

The six phases of the project included study acquisition, study coding, determination of intercoder objectivity, establishing criteria for inclusion of studies, computation of effect sizes for statistical analysis, and conducting the analyses. Studies were required to have been carried out in the United States, been experimental or quasi-experimental, and must have included effect size or the statistics necessary to calculate effect size. Sixty-one studies met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The following eight categories of teaching strategies were revealed during analysis of the studies (effect sizes in parentheses): Questioning Strategies (0.74); Manipulation Strategies (0.57); Enhanced Material Strategies (0.29); Assessment Strategies (0.51); Inquiry Strategies (0.65); Enhanced Context Strategies (1.48); Instructional Technology (IT) Strategies (0.48); and Collaborative Learning Strategies (0.95). All these effect sizes were judged to be significant. Regression analysis revealed that internal validity was influenced by Publication Type, Type of Study, and Test Type. External validity was not influenced by Publication Year, Grade Level, Test Content, or Treatment Categories.

The BLN is composed of small wireless nodes, which establish an spontaneous network topology at system initialization, and interact with Bluetooth-enabled user terminals (WLAN or GPRS PDAs, or WAP phones) or independent Bluetooth modems (badges). The BLN may coexist with any data protocol (IP over IEEE 802.11b or GPRS, WAP).

Fourteen experienced chemistry teachers participated in a workshop, coordinated by three CPD providers from the Department of Science Teaching, at the Weizmann Institute of Science. The meetings, lasting about three hours, were conducted once a month. Of the fourteen teachers, some were videotaped while conducting inquiry-type experiments in their classes, and were interviewed immediately afterwards. Based on the findings, we conclude that the CPD programme contributed to the professional development of the teachers. The teachers became more reflective and more aware of their practice.

The model was applied in a science education method course, which was offered in two different but consecutive semesters with a total enrollment of 111 students in the fall semester and 116 students in the spring semester. Using tools, such as multimedia authoring tools in the fall semester and modeling software in the spring semester, teacher educators designed high quality technology-infused lessons for science and, thereafter, modeled them in classroom for preservice teachers. An assessment instrument was constructed to assess preservice teachers' technology competency, which was measured in terms of four aspects, namely, (a) selection of appropriate science topics to be taught with technology, (b) use of appropriate technology-supported representations and transformations for science content, (c) use of technology to support teaching strategies, and (d) integration of computer activities with appropriate inquiry-based pedagogy in the science classroom. The results of a MANOVA showed that preservice teachers in the Modeling group outperformed preservice teachers' overall performance in the Multimedia group, F = 21.534, p = 0.000. More specifically, the Modeling group outperformed the Multimedia group on only two of the four aspects of technology competency, namely, use of technology to support teaching strategies and integration of computer activities with appropriate pedagogy in the classroom, F = 59.893, p = 0.000, and F = 10.943, p = 0.001 respectively.

Using interviews, the processes of generating explanatory hypotheses are analyzed and three types of hypotheses suggested by students are subsequently identified: theoretical, experiential, and auxiliary hypotheses. In addition, models of generating each type of explanatory hypothesis are also suggested. It is concluded that subjects use similarity-based reasoning to relate their background knowledge or experiences with the conflicting phenomena to be explained.

The teachers engaged in systematic, self-critical inquiry of their own practice and joined 8 other science teachers to engage in collaborative conversations about the nature of science, science teaching, and science education as a way of coming to a better understanding of how science can be taught for a more diverse group of students. Data were gathered via semistructured interviews, whole-group discussions, classroom observations, and review of supporting documents. Data analysis was based on narrative inquiry, where particular attention was given to the construction and reconstruction of the teachers' stories of their practical inquiries.

Previous studies showed, however, that preservice teachers even those with undergraduate degrees in science, generally do not spontaneously produce inscriptions thai economically summarize large amounts of data. This study was designed to investigate the production of inscription while a group of 15 graduate-level preservice science teachers engaged in a 15-week course of scientific observation and guided inquiry of two organisms. The course emphasized the production of inscriptions as a way of convincingly supporting claims when the students presented their results. With continuing emphasis on inscriptional representations, we observed a significant increase in the number and type of representations made as the course unfolded. The number of concrete, text-based inscriptions decreased as the number of graphs, tables and other sorts of complex inscriptions increased. As the students moved from purely observational activities to guided inquiry, they made many more transformations of their data into complex and abstract forms, such as graphs and concept maps. The participants' competencies to cross-reference ultimate transformations to initial research questions improved slightly.

Thirteen teachers enacted a project-based chemistry unit, How can I make new stuff from old stuff?, with 1197 seventh grade students. We videotaped each teacher's enactment of the focal lesson on scientific explanation and then coded the videotape for four different instructional practices: modeling scientific explanation, making the rationale of scientific explanation explicit, defining scientific explanation, and connecting scientific explanation to everyday explanation. Our results suggest that when teachers introduce scientific explanation, they vary in the practices they engage in as well as the quality of their use of these practices. We also found that teachers' use of instructional practices can influence student learning of scientific explanation and that the effect of these instructional practices depends on the context in terms of what other instructional practices the teacher uses. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The term literacy simply refers to the ability for one to read and write, but recent studies in language literacy have extended this definition. New literacy research seeks a redefinition in terms of how skills are used rather than how they are learned. Contemporary perspectives on literacy as a transfer of learned skills into daily life practises capture the understanding of what it means to be scientifically literate. Scientific literacy requires students to be able to use their scientific knowledge independently in the everyday world. Some models for teaching towards scientific literacy have been suggested including inquiry-based learning embedded in constructivist epistemologies. The inquiry-based model is posited to be effective at bringing about in-depth understanding of scientific concepts through engaging students' preconceptions. In order to establish whether directly engaging students' preconceptions can lead to in-depth understanding of the science of HIV/AIDS, a case study was designed to elucidate students' prior knowledge. From questionnaires and classroom observations, Ugandan Grade 11 students' persistent preconceptions were explored in follow-up focus group discussions. The inquiry process was used to engage students with their own perceptions of HIV/AIDS during the focus group discussions. Findings suggest that students need to dialogue with each other as they reflect on their beliefs about HIV/ AIDS. Dialogue enabled students to challenge their beliefs while making connections between 'school' and 'home' knowledge.","Article","Scopus"

The authors report on a case study of two chemistry teachers' heterogeneous classrooms at a racially diverse, public high school in California, where all students have been required to take chemistry since the school's founding in 1994. The authors highlight the following four beliefs and instructional practices that were instrumental in teachers' successful efforts to teach detracked chemistry classes: (1) teachers' true belief in a developmental conception ofability and intelligence; (2) a focus on an inquiry-based pedagogical approach to chemistry foregrounding real-world contexts; (3) a focus on teaching students study skills; and (4) a strong sense of community in the classroom, where students are held responsible for their own and each other's learning. To illustrate each of these findings, the authors select vivid examples from fieldnotes of classroom observations as well as interviews of teachers and students that make clear how teachers enacted and students experienced these elements in chemistry classrooms. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

In these partnerships the relationships with the scientists took many forms. We found that negotiations around five dimensions seemed particularly important: (1) Whose question was being investigated? (2) Was the focus primarily on data collection or data analysis?

The current expectation is that educational reform will foster greater student achievement via inquiry teaching within classrooms. Using assessments involving both conceptual and algorithmic knowledge of gas behaviour, gas laws, and phase changes in chemistry, this study aims to determine the relationship between inquiry teaching and student achievement. The topics were tested in the context of a unit from a reform-based curriculum that features inquiry, hands-on activities, and cooperative learning. This curriculum provides step-by-step guidance for each lesson in the teacher materials, in order to promote quality inquiry teaching. Two schools were involved in this study, with two high school chemistry teachers from each school. Each teacher participated in professional development and implemented this curriculum with sufficient training and guidance to develop reform methods. Student achievement was found to positively correlate with the use of inquiry teaching about the assessed concepts, regardless of teacher experience or school context.","Article","Scopus"

It discusses the design of an RBLE in the classroom by selecting an appropriate context with the assistance of computer-mediated learning resources and tools and employing the inquiry learning approach as the pedagogy. This study reports on the creation of the RBLE within the learning context of family trees. The computer-mediated learning resources and tools comprise three components: an audio-visual database for guided and coupled inquiry, an interactive interface for conceptualising the nomenclature and a tool for learners to construct their own family trees. Scaffolds were designed for an inquiry mode of learning and teaching to support the use of the resources and tools in learning about family trees. The learning and teaching process, including the outcomes for learners, through the RBLE with inquiry learning approach are studied. The findings of an interview and a pre-test/post-test study indicate that the RBLE can assist learners to build knowledge of family trees.

Inquiry-based instruction and successful inquiry learning and teaching in project-based science (PBS) were described in previous studies (Brown & Campione, 1990; Crawford, 1999; Krajcik, Blumenfeld, Marx, Bass, & Fredricks, 1998; Krajcik, Blumenfeld, Marx, & Solloway, 1994; Minstrell & van Zee, 2000). In this article, we describe the characteristics of inquiry teaching practices that promote student learning in urban schools. Teaching is a major factor that affects both achievement of and attitude of students toward science (Tamir, 1998). Our involvement in reform in a large urban district includes the development of suitable learning materials and providing continuous and practiced-based professional development (Fishman & Davis, in press; van Es, Reiser, Matese, & Gomez, 2002). Urban schools face particular challenges when enacting inquiry-based teaching practices like those espoused in PBS. In this article, we describe two case studies of urban teachers whose students achieved high gains on pre- and posttests and who demonstrated a great deal of preparedness and commitment to their students. Teachers' attempts to help their students to perform well are described and analyzed. The teachers we discuss work in a school district that strives to bring about reform in mathematics and science through systemic reform. The Center for Learning Technologies in Urban Schools (LeTUS) collaborates with the Detroit Public Schools to bring about reform in middle-school science. Through this collaboration, diverse populations of urban-school students learn science through inquiry-oriented projects and the use of various educational learning technologies. For inquiry-based science to succeed in urban schools, teachers must play an important role in enacting the curriculum while addressing the unique needs of students. The aim of this article is to describe patterns of good science teaching in urban school. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Given the situated nature of learning, we sought to examine how scientists understand recommended aspects of NOS and whether these views vary depending on the science discipline or investigative context of authentic practice. Participants were 24 scientists, representing four broad science disciplines (chemistry, life science, physics, earth/space science) and a variety of approaches (experimental, descriptive, theoretical). Data included questionnaires and interviews. Through intra-group and cross-group comparisons, we examine associations between NOS views, scientific disciplines, and methods of scientific inquiry. Results indicate NOS views are not necessarily related to science context. There appears to be as much variation within groups as across groups. Differences in views seem to be embedded within individual contexts and experiences rather than broader science disciplines. Results support the applicability of advocated NOS aspects across science contexts, and do not support a need to teach different natures of science in the K-12 science arena.

Participants were given a notebook that they could choose to use. Our results indicate consistent differences between the performance of adults versus children and also across time. First, there were clear differences in the number of participants who chose to take notes. Second, not only did adults write more notes than children, but also the adults' mean number of notes slightly increased over time, whereas children's notes actually decreased in frequency. Third, children and adults differed in the types of notes they took. These results are interpreted in terms of participants' awareness of what needs to be noted in a scientific task and why it needs to be noted, and they suggest implications for educational practice. First, because learners often have inaccurate representations of the task demands and their own future state of knowledge, they do not perceive the utility of notetaking. Second, because of these misperceptions, learners do not refer back to their notes and thereby miss feedback that would spur the refinement of their metacognitive (particularly metastrategic) knowledge and strategy use. Educators need to design opportunities for students to engage in activities that increase metacognitive knowledge of their own cognitive abilities and the demands of the task.","Article","Scopus"

This study seeks to investigate the viability of an educational heuristic based on a complex s ystems evolutionary approach to both harness complexity inherent in the learning system of the classroom and to improve student knowledge of a complex scientific issue. The evolutionary mechanisms of variation, interaction, and selection were used to construct a 10-day curriculum and instruction unit on the topic of genetic engineering. Eleven Grade 9 students participated in the study. The data analysis was completed using three data sources: daily database discussions and ratings and rationales provided over four time-points, probing student opinions and understanding of genetic engineering research. A repeated-measures analysis of variance conducted on 43 student rationales indicated a continuing trend of increasing understanding of complex systems concepts over time. There is also evidence to show that students as a whole group operated as a complex system in their patterns of decision-making. A number of themes identified in student database discussions reveal processes students themselves believed influenced change at the social and conceptual level, including the evolutionary mechanisms upon which the program was designed.","Article","Scopus"

We used a mixed method research design that combined quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to investigate two study teams of mentors. The teams were comprised of practice teachers and teacher educators that varied in their degree of familiarity with working collaboratively as a learning partnership. The findings of the study suggest that:•Mentors' beliefs about knowledge and knowing did not necessarily accord with their evaluations of desirable outcomes for knowledge construction in professional conversations. The events that mentors described as memorable learning opportunities were, however, congruent with their evaluations of the value of professional exchange in professional conversations.•The study teams differed in the way they articulated, elaborated, and evaluated knowledge construction in professional conversations. The teacher educators who comprised one of the study teams and who were familiar with collaborative knowledge construction exhibited a more articulate and worked out position on knowledge construction.

The professional development program consisted of a 2-week summer inquiry institute and research experience in university scientists' laboratories, as well as three academic year workshops. Insights gained from an in-depth study of these three secondary teachers resulted in a model of teacher conceptions that can be used to direct future inquiry professional development. Teachers' conceptions of inquiry teaching were established through intensive case-study research that incorporated extensive classroom observations and interviews. Through their participation in the professional development experience, the teachers gained a deeper understanding of how to implement inquiry practices in their classrooms. The teachers gained confidence and practice with inquiry methods through developing and presenting their institute-developed inquiry lessons, through observing other teachers' lessons, and participating as students in the workshop inquiry activities. Data analysis revealed that a set of four core conceptions guided the teachers' use of inquiry-based practices in their classrooms. The teachers' conceptions of science, their students, effective teaching practices, and the purpose of education influenced the type and amount of inquiry instruction performed in the high school classrooms.

The study focused on the development of students' (n = 30) awareness of the affordances of learning objects (LO) during the 3 inquiry tasks, and their ability of dynamically reconstructing meanings in the inquiry subtasks through exploiting these LO affordances in ""Young Scientist"". The problem-solving data recorded by the inquiry system and the awareness questionnaire served as the data-collection methods. It was demonstrated that learners obtain complete awareness of the LO affordances in an integrated learning environment only after several problem-solving tasks. It was assumed that the perceived task-related properties and functions of LOs depend on students' interrelations with LOs in specific learning contexts. Learners' overall awareness of certain LO affordances, available in the inquiry system ""Young Scientist"", developed with three kinds of patterns, describing the hierarchical development of the semiosphere model for learners. The better understanding of the LO affordances, characteristic to the formation of the functioning semiosphere, was significantly related to the advanced knowledge construction during these inquiry subtasks that presumed translation of information from one semiotic system to another. The implications of the research are discussed in the frames of the development of new contextual gateways for learning with virtual objects.

This interpretive study reports the unexpected positive learning outcomes for urban science students in two chemistry classes that resulted from the use of science demonstrations during a unit on gas laws. Beginning with an examination of science demonstrations as sites of interactions, researchers observed greater student engagement and positive emotional energy, more sophisticated use by students of symbol systems associated with chemistry, and a greater willingness of students to move between description of the phenomena and submicroscopic explanations. Applying sociology of emotions to analysis of classroom conversations and actions, we examine the nature of engagement and propose explanations for the positive effect of science demonstrations on the engagement, emotional energy, and learning of students. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The majority of the sample was comprised of informational texts, followed by experiment books and artistic books. Scientific knowledge was generally represented as facts, with limited connections to the producers of those facts. Scientists and their practice were represented as experiment or observation, in descriptions that blurred the distinctions between levels of participation in science, and emphasized empirical data collection over analysis or theory development. Artistic books focused on nature encouraged an aesthetic approach to nature, primarily through creative observation.

Arguments are often made about the effectiveness of these traditional strategies. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the inquiry-based approach known as the Science Writing Heuristic approach as a treatment to traditional teaching practices on students' post-test scores in relation to students' achievement level and teacher's implementation of the approach. A mixed-method research approach was used to analyze the teacher observational data and students' test results.

Specifically, the authors studied the effect of using a guided inquiry and modeling instructional framework (EIMA) and accompanying science methods instruction on preservice elementary teachers' science lesson design skills, scientific model use, and teaching orientations. Analysis of preservice teachers' pre-posttests, classroom artifacts, peer interviews, and lesson plans throughout the semester indicates that the framework successfully built on preservice teachers' prior instructional ideas, and that the majority of preservice teachers learned and used the framework in their lesson plans and teaching. Additionally, analysis of pre-posttest differences indicates an increase in posttest lesson plans that focused on engaging students in scientific inquiry using several kinds of models. Most importantly, the framework and accompanying instruction enabled two thirds of the class to move their teaching orientations away from discovery or didactic approaches toward reform-based approaches such as conceptual change, inquiry, and guided inquiry. Results from this study show that using instructional frameworks such as EIMA can enable preservice teachers to socially construct, synthesize, and apply their knowledge for enacting reform-oriented science teaching approaches such as model-centered scientific inquiry. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

Field observations and field trips can be constrained because of distance, time, expense, scale, safety, or complexity of real-world environments. Our objectives were to develop an environmental virtual field laboratory to study environmental properties and processes that stimulate the higher-order cognitive skills of students. We considered the following criteria for our virtual field laboratory: (i) global access, i.e., web-based implementation; (ii) simulation of a variety of learning mechanisms; (iii) interactivity to engage students; (iv) compartmentalization and hierarchical organizational structure; (v) abstraction of 2D and 3D geographic objects (e.g. soils, terrain) and dynamic ecosystem processes (e.g. water flow) using geostatistics and scientific visualization techniques. Cognitive science was considered during the design of our computer-aided instructional tools to enhance the effectiveness for learning. Our virtual field laboratory mimicked the students' learning processes that operate during real field trips and/or field observations; and provided students with a simulation environment to study environmental processes in space and time that cannot be provided on a real field trip. We implemented the following learning mechanisms: (i) exploration-based learning; (ii) analogy-based learning; (iii) science inquiry learning; (iv) abstraction-based learning. To engage students in our environmental virtual field laboratory, we implemented multiple interactivity functions including the exploration of 3D models and adaptive selective simulations. We used Virtual Reality Modeling Language, Java, Java Script, and External Authoring Interface to develop the environmental virtual field laboratory for a 42-ha flatwood site in Florida for which extensive datasets existed.

Both quantitative and qualitative methods of inquiry were used to capture the dynamic interaction within groups and the underlying factors that guided group process and decision-making. The results show that virtual learning groups can collaborate effectively from a distance to accomplish group tasks. The development of virtual learning teams is closely connected to the timeline for their class projects. Virtual teams are also similar in terms of their task process and the use of communication technologies. In contrast to face-to-face teams, the leadership role of virtual teams is shared among team members.

For various possible reasons, however, students tend not to be engaged in such inquiries. Among factors that may limit their opportunities to engage in open-ended inquiries of their design are teachers' conceptions about science. To explore possible relationships between teachers' conceptions about science and the types of inquiry activities in which they engage students, instrumental case studies of five secondary science teachers were developed, using field notes, repertory grids, samples of lesson plans and student activities, and semistructured interviews. Based on constructivist grounded theory analysis, participating teachers' tendencies to promote student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry projects seemed to correspond with positions about the nature of science to which they indicated adherence. A tendency to encourage and enable students to carry out student-directed, open-ended scientific inquiry projects appeared to be associated with adherence to social constructivist views about science. Teachers who opposed social constructivist views tended to prefer tight control of student knowledge building procedures and conclusions. We suggest that these results can be explained with reference to human psychological factors, including those associated with teachers' self-esteem and their relationships with knowledge-building processes in the discipline of their teaching. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

What criteria do they use when they critique these materials in preparation for adapting them, when they develop the criteria themselves and when they are given a set of criteria from which to choose? These results indicate that the 20 participating preservice elementary teachers held a sophisticated set of criteria for critiquing instructional materials; for example, they paid attention to scientific inquiry and instructional goals. In some cases, providing options from which they could select as a part of the instructional approach taken in the class allowed the preservice teachers to engage in substantive critique of the instructional materials along criteria not prominent in their initial set. Even with explicit support, however, the preservice teachers did not engage in substantive critique about how scientific content is represented. Furthermore, they typically describe inquiry as important to incorporate to promote student interest, not to engage students in genuine scientific activity. It is concluded that critique activities used in science methods courses should be authentic and scaffolded to be optimally effective. Critique along especially challenging dimensions needs systematic, explicit, and perhaps more consistent support. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Article","Scopus"

The written protocols that are available to the analyst provide an exact record of the instructional transactions at a given time in the online discussion. On the basis of a study of online discussion forums used in a higher education context, a model for the analysis of collaborative knowledge building in asynchronous discussion is presented. The model allows examination of the communication from the multiple perspectives of interaction, cognition and discourse analysis. The investigation was conducted using a qualitative case study approach and involved an in-depth examination of three cases. Content analysis of the discourse was done at a number of levels, focusing on the discussion forum itself, the discussion threads, the messages, and the exchanges and moves among the messages. As a result of correspondences found among the variables representing the different levels of the analysis, the most important being the relationship between type of interaction, phase of critical inquiry, and move in the exchange structure, it was possible to build a scheme for assessing knowledge building in asynchronous discussion groups. The scheme integrates the interactive, cognitive and discourse dimensions in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). The study represents a merging of quantitative analysis within qualitative methodology and provides both an analytic and a holistic perspective on CSCL. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The pedagogical rationale for the exercise was to give students a sense of investment and ownership in the process of scientific inquiry, to ""create a demand"" for knowledge of statistics and experimental methods, and to make a convincing case for empiricism as a way of knowing. The exercise generated enthusiasm, produced meaningful discussions, and increased students' understanding of experimentation, measurement, control, and statistics.

The proposals have an empirical basis in a wide range of studies of ideas about force and motion, and the developmental sequence takes account of Piagetian theories of cognitive development. The ideas presented do however go beyond available data, in an attempt to construct a coherent and potentially formalizable account of the developments, starting from only a very few primitive elements and showing how they could evolve into a complex system of reasoning. Our proposals are however not cast in a fully formal language, but are nevertheless subject to certain formal constraints, each new element being defined in terms of pre-existing elements, and once introduced being used with a fixed meaning.

The analysis reveals that the dynamic visual display (DVD) is generally more effective than the static visual display (SVD).

These conflicting findings seem to be related to the different theoretical rationales and methodological approaches used in various studies and suggest that the use of DVDs should be determined selectively. From the literature review and theoretical discussions about instructional functions of DVDs, we propose six instructional conditions under which DVDs can be effectively used. The conditions are for: (a) demonstrating sequential actions in a procedural task; (b) simulating causal models of complex system behaviors; (c) explicitly representing invisible system functions and behaviors; (d) illustrating a task which is difficult to describe verbally; (e) providing a visual analogy for an abstract and symbolic concept, and (f) obtaining attention focused on specific tasks or presentation displays.

The theories were applied to a normal classroom setting of grade‐9 and ‐10 students (N = 159) involved in a scientific inquiry—a simulation of scientific decision making. In their attempt to resolve conceptual conflicts concerning a pendulum's period, the students worked towards a consensus. It was discovered that student beliefs at the end of the simulation deviated from this group consensus. Neither the SDS or the DV theories could account for this result, except in one extreme case. The psychological state of the decision makers (vigilant, hypervigilant, etc.) was mildly associated with this deviation. The predictive function of the SDS and DV models was apparently severely hampered by the natural complexities common to classroom interactions. However, the study did illuminate factors that likely affect conceptual change in the context of classroom group decision making; and the study discovered strategies which students invented in order to maintain their alternative conceptions of motion related to the pendulum, in the face of conflicting evidence. These results are discussed in terms of the students' participation in the scientific inquiry. Copyright © 1989 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company","Article","Scopus"

Knowledge integration requires students to expand their repertoire of ideas but unless those ideas are reflected upon, they cannot be linked to and reconciled with current ideas. Students are capable of doing this kind of reflection but, many need scaffolding. Scaffolding— here in the form of reflection prompts— can help students be autonomous integrators of their knowledge. This research investigated learning and design questions. It determined whether reflection prompts promote knowledge integration for students working on science projects and investigated the effects of students’ different dispositions on their reflection. It explored which characteristics of prompts best support students in knowledge integration. The learning results indicate that prompting students to reflect significantly increases knowledge integration in science projects. Yet similar prompts elicit qualitatively diverse responses from students. Students who focus on their ideas perform significantly better on the end product than do other students who focus on their actions or activities. Furthermore, students who indicate that they understand everything perform significantly worse on the final project than do other students. The design results show that self-monitoring prompts, which encourage planning for and reflection on activities, help students to demonstrate an integrated understanding of the relevant science; while activity prompts, which guide the inquiry process, are less successful in prompting knowledge integration. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","Article","Scopus"

The Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIIS) was adopted as the focal component of the overall curriculum with subsequent, planned innovations to occur in accordance with the Concerns‐Based Adoption Model. The purpose of this study was to assess the attitudes toward science of students who had completed one year of SCIIS compared to students in non‐SCIIS classes. In addition, the attitudes of teachers who received inservice education and who had instructed SCIIS were compared to non‐SCIIS teachers. While SCIIS and non‐SCIIS teachers possess similar perceptions of science, drastic attitudinal differences were observed between SCIIS and non‐SCIIS students.

This extensive teaching resource was developed over three years by the University of Reading and The Open University as a consortium project on behalf of the HE sector. It was funded by the four UK Higher Education Funding Councils, through the Teaching and Learning Technology (TLTP) initiative. FLAP is a high quality supported self-study resource covering first year and foundation year physics and its associated mathematics. It allows physics departments to create courses of their own design and specification quickly as they respond to a diversifying and changing intake. It is now two years since the launch of FLAP and it is timely to reflect on the lessons that have been learned. This article describes the FLAP resource in some detail and reports its implementation and evaluation at the University of Reading. Evaluation shows that FLAP delivers many of the expected benefits, with significant gains in the quality and effectiveness of teaching and learning.

The intended consequence of instigating the rational theory of management by one state is to improve their current level of student literacy. However, some contend that the implementation of the policy has results that are not intended. The identification of the tension between the intended and unintended results of centralized policy making is the basis for examining a specific case in which the rational model is implemented. One hundred and sixty‐five seventh‐grade science students and four teachers are participants in the study. Qualitative analysis is the research methodology used as a means to provide detailed information about the contextual nature of the classroom processes. The intention is to identify and describe features of the behavior setting that influence the behavior of the teachers and their students. Three assertions generated during the field work were: Teachers redefine the goals of science instruction as the acquisition of facts and isolated skills, teachers alter their usual instructional behavior to implement uniform instructional procedures, and the teacher/student classroom interaction constrains students' opportunities to learn science. The implications of the study indicate that the state‐mandated policy has results that are in opposition to the intended results. Instead of improving the practices of teachers, the implementation of the policy constrains and routinizes the teachers' behavior, causing them to violate their own standards of good teaching. They feel pressured to “get through” the materials so students will score well on tests. The classroom interaction is structured in such a way as to inhibit students from asking questions of their own. As a result, students' opportunity to express curiosity and inquiry—central processes in scientific thinking—are constrained. These unintended consequences of the implemented state policy, instead of improving science teaching and learning, continue to reduce science instruction to the literal comprehension of isolated facts and skills.

The role of scientific visualization within science is explicated through examples of its use and by presenting a sociological account of science that portrays scientific visualization as an important new inscriptional system. Three examples of using scientific visualization within education are provided: the ChemViz Project at the National Center for Supercomputing Activities, the Image Processing For Teaching (IPT) project at the University of Arizona, and an undergraduate climatology course at the University of Chicago. Potential problems of integrating scientific visualization within secondary education are described, including students' need to learn basic scientific practices, incompatibilities between the format of the traditional high-school classroom and scientific inquiry, and the need for additional infrastructure within schools. Finally, possible solutions to these problems are described, culminating in a view of scientific visualization as a means to provide education with an important new inscriptional system for exploratory, inquiry-driven learning and to link the aims of education to the practices of science. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The data sources included videotaped lessons, audiotaped interviews, and teacher-student interactions, and the artifacts constructed by students and teacher-researchers in the course of the study. Our analyses document and discuss the enormous work done by students in constructing research problems and resolving these problems through engaging in field research. During field research, many local problems emerged, which students learned to resolve interactionally with their peers and the settings. The students' framing of problems for research and work in the field setting stood in sharp contrast to their work on teacher-constructed, contextual word problems. These differences led us to a critical analysis of traditional word problems. The students' achievements in each of these situations emerged out of their interactions within a classroom community that encouraged independence, collaboration, and negotiation of meaning, and with the physical setting. Students' achievements and learning were meaningful because they were indexed to, and situated in, the setting of the students' experience. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Three analyses are presented in order to: (1) portray the character of students' spontaneous answers; (2) examine the criteria students use to decide whether specific items are models or not; and (3) describe how different general levels of understanding models reflect different epistemological viewpoints. Four experts were also interviewed for purposes of comparison. We found that students in both groups have conceptions of models that are basically consistent with a naive realist epistemology. Thus, they are more likely to think of models as physical copies of reality that embody different spatiotemporal perspectives than as constructed representations that may embody different theoretical perspectives. As student ideas become more sophisticated, however, they increasingly include the fact that models are designed for particular purposes, especially to help communication. All of our experts expressed ideas consistent with a constructivist framework, drawing a distinction between abstract and physical models and articulating ways that models are used for the construction and testing of ideas. Our findings suggest that students need more experience using models as intellectual tools, more experience with models that provide contrasting conceptual views of phenomena, and more discussions of the roles of models in the service of scientific inquiry.

To remediate this problem, researchers have called for constructivist learning environments in which students can pursue open inquiry and frame their own research problems. The present study was designed to describe and understand students' experimenting and problem solving in such an environment. An interpretive research methodology was adopted for the construction of meaning from the data. The data sources included videotapes, their transcripts, student laboratory reports and reflections, interviews with the students, and the teacher's course outline and reflective notes. Forty‐six students from three sections of an introductory physics course taught at a private school for boys participated in the study. This article shows the students' remarkable ability and willingness to generate research questions and to design and develop apparatus for data collection. In their effort to frame research questions, students often used narrative explanations to explore and think about the phenomena to be studied. In some cases, blind alleys, students framed research questions and planned experiments that did not lead to the expected results. We observed a remarkable flexibility to deal with problems that arose during the implementation of their plans in the context of the inquiry. These problems, as well as their solutions and the necessary decision‐making processes, were characterized by their situated nature. Finally, students pursued meaningful learning during the interpretation of data and graphs to arrive at reasonable answers of their research questions. We concluded that students should be provided with problem‐rich learning environments in which they learn to investigate phenomena of their own interest and in which they can develop complex problem‐solving skills.

In two classes students' interactions with a scientific data base—Birds of Antarctica—were closely monitored, and the mediating roles of the teachers' epistemologies were examined. Interpretive data were generated and analyzed in relation to a constructivist perspective on learning. In the class where the teacher implemented a constructivist‐oriented pedagogy, students took advantage of enhanced opportunities to generate creative questions and conduct complex scientific investigations. These higher‐level thinking skills were much less evident in the class in which a more transmissionist‐oriented pedagogy prevailed.

SDT provides a direct-manipulation interface with which users can create a scenario by selecting required simulation components provided by the system. The users then interactively define the properties of each chosen component and relationships among the components.

During the planning and the data interpretation phases of an experiment, interactions were primarily verbal and took shape according to the behaviour of participating individuals. From the analysis of the degree of participation by different members of a group, three major patterns of interaction emerged: symmetric, asymmetric, and shifting asymmetric.

Specifically, the purpose of this study was to investigate possible differences in students’ scientific reasoning abilities relative to their informal learning environments (impoverished, enriched), classroom teaching experiences (non-inquiry, inquiry) and the interaction of these variables. The results of two-way ANOVAs indicated that informal learning environments and classroom science teaching procedures showed significant main effects on students’ scientific reasoning abilities. Students with enriched informal learning environments had significantly higher scientific reasoning abilities compared to those with impoverished informal learning environments. Likewise, students in inquirybased science classrooms showed higher scientific reasoning abilities compared to those in non-inquiry science classrooms. There were no significant interaction effects.

According to this view, attempts to teach children about the content and form of physical theories are doomed to failure. We argue that this is not the case. Children can learn basic physical concepts and models, given appropriately designed instruction. Furthermore, physical theories are a good domain for teaching children about the nature of scientific knowledge: its form, its evolution, and its application. This article describes an approach that enables sixth graders (i.e., 11- and 12-yearolds) to develop a conceptual model that embodies the principles underlying Newtonian mechanics, and to apply their model in making predictions, solving problems, and generating explanations. The students’ learning centers around problem solving and experimentation with a series of computer microworlds (i.e., a set of interactive simulations and modeling tools that we developed called ThinkerTools). The objective is for students to construct a series of increasingly sophisticated models for reasoning about how forces affect the motion of objects. To facilitate the evolution of such conceptual models, the microworlds incorporate a variety of linked alternative representations for force and motion, and a set of game-like activities designed to focus the students’ inquiry processes. As part of the pedagogical approach, students formalize what they learn into a set of laws that they examine critically, using criteria such as correctness, generality, and parsimony. They then apply these laws and representations to a variety of real-world problems. This approach integrates the learning of the subject matter with learning about the nature of scientific knowledge-what are scientific models, how do they evolve, and why are they useful? Instructional trials revealed that the ThinkerTools curriculum is equally effective for males and females and for students of different ability levels. Furthermore, sixth graders taught with this approach did better in solving a set of classic force and motion problems than did high school students taught using traditional methods. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We acknowledge and build on the empirical results of misconceptions research but question accompanying views of the character, origins, and growth of students' conceptions. Students have often been viewed as holding flawed ideas that are strongly held, that interfere with learning, and that instruction must confront and replace. We argue that this view overemphasizes the discontinuity between students and expert scientists and mathematicians, making the acquisition of expertise difficult to conceptualize. It also conflicts with the basic premise of constructivism: that students build more advanced knowledge from prior understandings. Using case analyses, we dispute some commonly cited dimensions of discontinuity and identify important continuities that were previously ignored or underemphasized. We highlight elements of knowledge that serve both novices and experts, albeit in different contexts and under different conditions. We provide an initial sketch of a constructivist theory of learning that interprets students' prior conceptions as resources for cognitive growth within a complex systems view of knowledge. This theoretical perspective aims to characterize the interrelationships among diverse knowledge elements rather than identify particular flawed conceptions; it emphasizes knowledge refinement and reorganization, rather than replacement, as primary metaphors for learning; and it provides a framework for understanding misconceptions as both flawed and productive. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The question addressed in this study is, To what extent do students appropriate scientific ways of knowing and reasoning as a result of their participation in collaborative scientific inquiry? The focus of our analysis was on changes in students' conceptual knowledge and use of hypotheses, experiments, and explanations to organize their reasoning in the context of two think aloud problems. In September the students' reasoning was nonanalytic and bound to personal experience. They responded as if they were being asked to answer questions in a reading comprehension task. In contrast, by June they reasoned in terms of a larger explanatory system, used hypotheses to organize and give direction to their reasoning, and demonstrated an awareness of the function of experimentation in producing evidence to evaluate hypotheses. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Often, these laboratory practicals do not achieve their goals and may even confuse or demotivate students. It is not that using ‘wet’ practicals is intrinsically wrong; rather, it is that they are often used for the wrong reasons. They do have a place in science curricula - for the conveyance of tacit knowledge that can only be achieved in the laboratory setting. In our view, their use should be restricted to that. Non-laboratory practicals (‘dry labs’), and especially multimedia practicals, tend to be used for completely different reasons. They are best used to help students achieve specific cognitive skills (such as analysis, synthesis and evaluation) needed to practise science and to carry out scientific inquiry.

This curriculum integrated several learning strategies into a single approach: advance organizers, the learning cycle, concept maps, Vee diagrams, a focusing strategy, and writing. Two general questions were addressed. First, was the DIAL(SPS)2 treatment more effective than a conventional treatment? Second, was there evidence of an aptitude‐treatment interaction? Four high‐school biology classes taught by this investigator were used to test the DIAL(SPS)2 curriculum. Scheduling of students involved ability grouping. To test the curriculum in the most rigorous way, the experimental group consisted of average ability students and the comparison group consisted of above‐average students. Both the groups were pretested in August and posttested in May. In the intervening time, the experimental group received the DIAL(SPS)2 treatment while the comparison group received a more traditional approach. Analysis of covariance revealed that the DIAL(SPS)2 curriculum had no significant effect on the learning of science process skills or on cognitive development. Aptitude‐treatment interaction analyses revealed an interaction of DIAL(SPS)2 treatment and cognitive development. Copyright © 1989 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company","Article","Scopus"

On the other hand, the teaching of domain‐independent, context‐free skills has been subject to criticism on the ground that important aspects of cognitive activities are functions of meaningful contexts. The intent of this study was to examine the development of integrated process skills in the context of open‐inquiry laboratory sessions. The data‐collection approach was qualitative and included videotapes of laboratory sessions, laboratory reports of students, and the reflective journals kept by the two teachers involved in the study. Forty‐eight students from the Grade 11 introductory physics course, 29 students from the Grade 12 physics course, and 60 students from the Grade 8 general science course from an all‐boys private school participated in the study. An interpretive research methodology was adopted for construction of meaning from the data. Students worked in collaborative groups during all of the open‐inquiry laboratory sessions. Findings from the study indicate that students develop higher‐order process skills through nontraditional laboratory experiences that provided the students with freedom to perform experiments of personal relevance in authentic contexts. Students learned to (a) identify and define pertinent variables, (b) interpret, transform, and analyze data, (c) plan and design an experiment, and (d) formulate hypotheses. Findings of this study suggest that process skills need not be taught separately. Integrated process skills develop gradually and reach a high level of sophistication when experiments are performed in meaningful context.

In the present study, classroom variables that were related to changes in students' conceptions of science were identified. Particular attention was directed toward students' overall conceptions of scientific knowledge and their views of its tentative nature. Twenty‐five classroom variables were found to be significantly related to both overall and tentative conceptions, while 12 variables were found to be scale‐specific. A comparison between teacher and student conceptions of science did not support the prevalent assumption that a teacher's conception of science is significantly related to changes in students' conceptions of science. “Successful” classes were defined as those exhibiting the greatest student conceptual changes toward the viewpoint held by the teacher, irrespective of the “adequacy” of the teacher's viewpoint. In general, these classes were typified by frequent inquiry‐oriented questioning with little emphasis on rote memory. Implicit references to the nature of science were commonly observed. Furthermore, where greatest changes in student conceptions of science were observed, the teachers were pleasant, supportive, and frequently used anecdotes to promote instruction and establish rapport. Emphasis on the depth, breadth, and accuracy of content statistically differentiated between “successful” and “unsuccessful” classes with respect to students' overall conceptions. However, this emphasis on content presentation did not differentiate classes with respect to students' conceptions of the tentative nature of science.

The results of the re‐synthesis generally supported the conclusions drawn in the earlier meta‐analysis by Shymansky, Kyle, and Alport (1983); i.e., that the new science curricula of the 60's and 70's were more effective in enhancing student performance than traditional textbook‐based programs of the time. But the re‐synthesis also revealed some notable differences as well. For example, in the re‐synthesis mean effects were significantly positive on four performance clusters (achievement, process skills, problem solving, and attitude) compared to seven clusters in the earlier analysis, and then by a smaller margin (the 1981 mean was 0.34 and the 1986 mean was 0.25). In one case (related skills), the mean effect changed from a +0.25 (significant at the 0.05 level) to –0.10. But perhaps more important than any particular change in the many analyses performed, the application of refined statistical procedures in the re‐synthesis yielded results of greater precision than those generated in the original study.

Furthermore, the framing of theories and the working out of their consequences involve the exercise of the imagination. One locus of scientific imagination is the thought experiment, primarily understood as a mental device that helps explicate concepts and principles, and unravel paradoxes. A sound curriculum in physics, however, must also be based on broad principles of education. These principles are first stated and then it is argued that in conjunction with what we have said about scientific thinking we should teach physics in terms of contexts of inquiry. These contexts relate to questions, method, problems, experiments, history, and the large context problem itself. Here we find the clarification of induction and deduction, as well as the proper placing of the thought experiment. In the appendix it is shown how this contextual approach can be used for the teaching of kinematics. It is claimed that when we teach within the contexts of inquiry, physics is liberated from a specifiable method, and becomes historical, relevant, alive, human and exciting. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Epistemological models of the evolution of scientific knowledge and the development of rational thinking have generated the metaphor of the science learner as a scientist: we argue that these models constrain rather than empower the inquiry and the interpretation of the learning processes occurring in the classroom. Our studies about learning in the biological domain approach the process of change, and examples are produced to illustrate that change is not localized in content structures, nor does it necessarily come about through conflict and replacement of pre-existing ideas and practices. Change involves a set of ways of thinking about a conceptual domain, which are elicited in specific contexts of action and discourse. It results in an ""opportunistic"" differentiation among contexts of interpretation. ""But which is the stone that supports the bridge?,"" Kublai Khan asks.

An inquiry classification scheme was used for the remaining segment. Four questions were answered: (1) To what extent do elementary science textbooks focus on each Project Synthesis goal cluster? (2) In which part of the text is such information found? (3) To what extent are the activities and experiments merely verifications of information already introduced in the text? (4) If inquiry is present in an activity, then what is the level of such inquiry? Eleven science textbook series, which comprise approximately 90 percent of the national market, were selected for analysis. Two units, one primary (K‐3) and one intermediate (4‐6), were selected for analysis by first identifying units common to most series, then randomly selecting one primary and one intermediate unit for analysis. Each randomly selected unit was carefully read, using the sentence as the unit of analysis. Each declarative and interrogative sentence in the body of the text was classified as: (1) academic; (2) personal; (3) career; or (4) societal in its focus. Each illustration, except those used in evaluation items, was similarly classified. Each activity/experiment and each miscellaneous sentence in end‐of‐chapter segments labelled “review,” “summary,” “evaluation,” etc., were similarly classified. Finally, each activity/experiment, as a whole, was categorized according to a four‐category inquiry scheme (confirmation, structured inquiry, guided inquiry, open inquiry). In general, results of the analysis are: (1) most text prose focuses on academic science; (2) most remaining text prose focuses on the personal goal cluster; (3) the career and societal goal clusters receive only minor attention; (4) text illustrations exhibit a pattern similar to text prose; (5) text activities/experiments are academic in orientation, almost to the exclusion of other goal clusters; (6) end‐of‐chapter sentences are largely academic; (7) inquiry is absent or present only in limited forms in text activities/experiments; and (8) texts allocate only a minor portion of space to activities/experiments. Detailed findings are given as numeral, percentage, and decimal values. Discussion focuses on the implications of the results and a comparison of NSTA recommendations with the results of this analysis.

A random sample consisting of 64 subjects was selected for experimental and control groups from a population of 120 bilingual Mexican American third graders. The Solomon Four‐Group experimental design was employed. Pre‐ and posttesting was performed by use of the Goldstein‐Sheerer Object Sorting Test, (GSOST) and the Test of Oral Communication Skills, (TOCS). The experimental group participated in a sequential series of science lessons which required manipulation of objects, exploration, peer interaction, and teacher‐pupil interaction. The children made observations and comparisons of familiar objects and then grouped them on the basis of perceived and inferred attributes. Children worked individually and in small groups. Analysis of variance procedures was used on the posttest scores to determine if there was a significant improvement in classification and oral communication skills in the experimental group. The results on the posttest scores indicated a significant improvement at the 0.01 level for the experimental group in both classification and oral communication skills. It was concluded that participation in the science inquiry lessons facilitated the development of classification and oral communication skills of bilingual children.

In the textbook series studied, the frequency of the portrayal of science as a process of inquiry increased from 1956 to 1965, then showed a pattern of decline in 1977 and 1985. The results further indicate that the frequency of portrayal of science as a process of inquiry was higher in introductory chapters of the textbooks and in chapters dealing with the topic of genetics and lower in chapters dealing with leaf structure.

For many instructors, however, promoting student inquiry is a difficult agenda to pursue for two reasons. First, there is often tension for instructors between concerns for this agenda and more traditional concerns for the correctness and completeness of students' understanding. Second, it is not easy to recognize when productive student inquiry is taking place. For a teacher in class, what is valuable about the students' participation at any given moment may’not be as obvious as what is flawed and ambiguous in their arguments. For this article, I analyze a short excerpt from a high school physics class discussion to consider the value of the students' work as inquiry and to illustrate a teacher's negotiation of the tension between inquiry and traditional content-oriented concerns. In this way, I try to discover the beginnings of science in what the students say and do, rather than to apply criteria from a particular model of scientific reasoning. This exploration for students' knowledge and abilities is offered both as an approach to research on student inquiry and as a mode of instructional practice to support that inquiry. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The sample consisted of 1,269 students enrolled in 40 science classes distributed equally among ten junior high schools, five metropolitan and five rural. Classes were further classified according to sex (21 boys and 19 girls classes) and ability (19 high and 21 low ability classes). Using the Learning Environment Inventory (Anderson, Walberg, & Fraser, 1982) to measure climate, science classes in metropolitan schools, more than rural, were found to be characterized by Speed, Friction, Favoritism, Difficulty, Cliqueness, and Competitiveness. No differences were found in the classroom climates of classes in which students were grouped according to sex or ability. Using the Test of Science‐Related Attitudes (Fraser, 1981), students in science classes in metropolitan schools, in contrast to rural, expressed more positive attitudes toward the Social Implications of Science, Adoption of Scientific Attitudes, and Attitude to Scientific Inquiry. Boys more than girls recorded high scores on Leisure Interest in Science and Career Interest in Science. High ability students were found to have higher scores on Attitude to Scientific Inquiry than did low ability students. When examining the relationship between the 15 subscale scores of the LEI and the seven subscale scores of the TOSRA for the 40 classes, only 9 out of 105 correlations proved to be significant. Most differences in climate, attitude, and their interactions were attributed to school location rather than to student characteristics.

The two groups were instructed on two different science topics utilizing different inquiry strategies. Achievement data from topic specific tests were analyzed by an ANOVA technique. The results indicated that age made a significant difference on achievement for both inquiry strategies. The significant contributions were due to the differences between grade one and grades three and five. The differences between grade three and grade five were not significant.

The BSCS approach emphasized basic and integrated science processes, concept development through extensive questioning, and increased student discretion, while the traditional approach contained highly structured, more prescriptive, teacher‐oriented activities. Intact laboratory sections of students enrolled in introductory general biology at two private liberal‐arts colleges were randomly selected into two treatment groups. Pretest and posttest measures were taken on three dependent variables: (1) biological content achievement, measured with a researcher‐generated Test on Biology Laboratory Concepts, (2) reasoning ability, measured with the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking, and (3) attitude toward biology, measured with the Biology Student Behavior Inventory. Analysis of covariance indicated the experimental group (n = 60) using the BSCS‐style laboratory approach scored significantly higher than the comparison group (n = 59) in levels of performance on biology content achievement, F(1, 114) = 4.07, p < 0.05. There were no significant differences between the two groups in performance levels on attitude toward biology or on reasoning ability. However, both groups experienced a 15‐percent increase in the number of formal thinkers as indicated by pretest‐posttest gain scores on the reasoning ability test. These results lend support to the hypothesis that a BSCS‐style laboratory approach fosters desired learner outcomes at the postsecondary level. In addition, these findings support the notion that the science laboratory may be used as a primary vehicle to promote formal reasoning skills.

The sample consisted of a national stratified random sample of 1955 17‐year‐olds who were assessed as part of the 1981‐1982 national assessment in science. The dependent variable was a 17‐item measure of students' inquiry skill. The independent variables were selected from the available data using the Model of Educational Productivity as a guide in the selection of the variables. The first purpose of the study was to test the effectiveness of the Model of Educational Productivity for predicting the inquiry skill of 17‐year‐olds. The results of this study indicate that this model was capable of accounting for between 24 and 32% of the variance in inquiry skill for the general population of 17‐year‐olds. More specifically, students' reporting of their general ability alone accounted for between 17 and 22% of the variance. The second question posed by this study asked whether the prediction of inquiry skill differed for males and females. While there was some difference in the contribution of the minor predictors, there was very little difference in the prediction of inquiry skill for males and females using the Model of Education Productivity. The third question posed by this study asked whether the prediction of inquiry skill differed for white and nonwhite students. For nonwhite students, the Model of Educational Productivity accounted for only 18% of the variance in science inquiry skill. Thus, it would appear that there is a great deal that is not known about the factors that contribute to the science inquiry skill of nonwhite students.

The reviewed attempts could be categorized into two general approches: implicit and explicit. Implicit attempts utilized science process-skills instruction or engagement in science-based inquiry activities to improve science teachers’ conceptions of NOS. To achieve the same goal, explicit attempts used instruction geared towards various aspects of NOS and/or instruction that utilized elements from history and philosophy of science. To the extent that teachers’ NOS conceptions were faithfully assessed by the instruments used in the reviewed studies, the explicit approach was relatively more effective in enhancing teachers’ views. The relative ineffectiveness of the implicit approach could be attributed to two inherent assumptions. The first is that developing an understanding of NOS is an ‘affective’, as compared to a ‘cognitive’, learning outcome. The second ensuing assumption is that learners would necessarily develop understandings of NOS as a by-product of engaging in science-realated activities. However, despite the relative ‘effectiveness’ of the explicit approach, much is still required in terms of fostering among science teachers ‘desired’ understandings of NOS. The paper emphasizes that explicitness and reflectivness should be given prominence in any future attempts aimed at improving teachers’ concepts of NOS. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","Review","Scopus"

Aside from the fact that the literature is very sparse in this area about what obtains in developing countries, nothing appears to be available with regard to how wait‐time interacts with the sociocultural factors within non‐Western science classrooms. In a non‐Western country such as Nigeria where most science programs in schools are inquiry‐oriented, do teachers take notice of, and effectively use, wait‐time in the teaching‐learning process? Are science teachers able to effectively use the mediating role of sociocultural factors in science teaching in a traditional environment which expects children to be seen only and not heard? The main purpose of this study was to investigate the wait‐time of Nigerian integrated science teachers in relation to the amount of students' participation in inquiry. This study also investigated the relationship between wait‐time and sociocultural attitudinal factors prevalent in traditional societies. The instruments used for data collection were the Hough's Observational Schedule and a modified version of the Socio‐Cultural Environment Scale (SCES); a stop‐watch was used to measure the wait‐time of audio‐recorded integrated science lessons of 37 integrated science teachers from selected junior secondary schools in Kaduna State, Nigeria. The results showed that the average wait‐time TT and wait‐time ST of the integrated science teachers was 3.0 seconds and 0.7 seconds, respectively. The study reported the amount of student participation in the student‐teacher classroom discourse to be very low. Wait‐time was also shown to have a strong relationship with sociocultural factors of authoritarianism, goal structure, societal expectation, and traditional worldview.

This assessment differs from others in that respondents can choose “I don't know” rather than guessing. This paper examines explanations for the gender differences including (a) differential prior instruction, (b) differential response to uncertainty and use of the “I don't know” response, (c) differential response to figurally presented items, and (d) different attitudes towards science. Of these possible explanations, the first two received support. Females are more likely to use the “I don't know” response, especially for items with physical science content or masculine themes such as football.

It had previously been found productive in a high‐school setting. The approach provides considerably less specific procedure for the students to follow than did a guided‐inquiry approach and required relatively high independence. Four hundred sixty‐nine students taking university introductory biology were randomly assigned to using either the ED learning approach or one characterized as guided inquiry for one semester. Three measures were taken to verify that instructional treatments followed the two approaches. All indicated qualitative and quantitative differences between ED and GI approaches in the direction predicted by the operational definitions. The criterion variables were (1) student scores on a multiple‐choice laboratory exam, (2) student scores on laboratory reports, and (3) student scores on six laboratory quizzes given during the semester. The only criterion variable which showed significant differences between groups (laboratory‐report scores) also showed significant group‐by‐instructor interaction. The hypothesis of no difference therefore stood unrejected for all criterion variables. Since the ED approach appears to produce equivalent learning gains in understanding of biology laboratory concepts compared to a guided‐inquiry approach, this approach should still be considered for laboratory teaching, because it purports to train for discretionary use of resources during instruction in addition to the conventional development of laboratory concepts.

The intellectual and emotional viewpoints of selected scientists, science educators, science teachers, and prospective science teachers are examined regarding the relationship between their orthodox Christian religious beliefs and biological evolutionary theory. We view the prospect of teaching evolution to students with such a religious commitment as a prime example of the severe limitations of cognitively‐oriented conceptual change theory. We also view conflicts between religion and science regarding evolution as a bona fide example of a multicultural issue in education. These theoretical perspectives are inconsistent with the common tendency among science professionals to view or treat orthodox Christian students in a manner unconscionable with others—to disrespect their intellect or belittle their motivations, to offer judgments based on stereotypes and prejudices, to ignore threats to personal selfesteem, or to deny the de facto connection of some scientific conceptions to the morals, attitudes, and values of individuals with such religious commitments.

In an analysis of the teachers' descriptions of that restriction, many teachers were found to regard this as a question of control over the educational process.

Instead, they should make the student consider the mistakes and contradictions they themselves discover in the correction process. The Socratic dialogue applies a dialectic method to present questions to the student and lets the student reconsider his or her own thinking. In this research, we shall make an inquiry into the fundamental reasoning principles of the Socratic dialogue and use the production rules to express the principles that will be used for the learning of subtraction.

A constructivist perspective was used to design the study and to assemble the data sources. These data sources included videotapes of students in their work, audiotapes of teacher–student interactions and teacher interviews, the transcripts of these tapes, the students' field notebooks, field reports, special problem assignments, examinations, and the teachers' curriculum guides, field notes, and reflective journal. An interpretive method was used to construct assertions and the supporting data. In the setting provided, students increasingly used mathematical representations such as graphs and data tables to support their claims in a convincing manner; the use of abstract equations and percent calculations did not change over the course of the study. Representations such as graphs, maps, averages, and equations were not only useful as inscriptions (representations in some permanent medium, usually paper), but also as conscription devices in the construction of, and through which, students engaged each other to collaboratively construct meaning. This study demonstrates the use of representations as conscription devices, and illustrates how the use and understanding of inscriptions changes over time. Understanding representations as inscription and conscription devices focuses on the social aspects of knowing, which has important implications for teachers' conceptualization of learning and their organization of science classrooms.

Sixteen fifth‐ and sixth‐graders worked on two experimentation problems consistent with the engineering and science models, respectively. The context in which these problems were framed was also varied, to encourage adoption of either an engineering or science model. Over six 40‐min sessions, the group achieved significant increases in the percentages of inferences about variables that were both correct and valid. Improvement was greatest for those who began with the engineering problem and then went on to the science problem. The science model was associated with broader exploration, more selectiveness about evidence interpreted, and greater attention to establishing that some variables are not causal. The findings suggest that research on scientific inquiry processes should attend not only to the science content students are reasoning about, but also to their beliefs about the goals of inquiry.

However, when used to teach at a more conceptual level, students often encounter difficulties in learning from simulation. This has led to the conclusion that additional learning support needs to be included. The paper describes a formative evaluation study in which medical students were recorded interacting with a simulation model of calcium balance. Video protocols were analysed according to students' performance on diagnostic and patient management tasks, and the quality of their understanding of the physiological model that lies behind the simulation. The role of dialogue interaction, between students and between experimenter and student, was investigated as a potential source of learning support. Since existing dialogue analysis techniques required extension and synthesis to serve our goals, a specially devised mark-up scheme DISCOUNT was used for the analysis. Insights were gained from an examination of learning in relation to types of dialogue and these were further supported by students' own views concerning the value of the system. Although all students demonstrated learning gains, these were greater amongst single students interacting with the experimenter than amongst students co-operating on tasks in pairs. Dialogue analysis revealed that experimenter - student interaction contained many more inquiries causing students to explain their reasoning, justify their conclusions, or state implications from data. This prompting of reflective activity seemed to result in a deeper understanding of the physiological model. The implications of this are that interaction of an inquiry style needs to be encouraged for maximum learning benefit to be gained and, if support can be built in to the simulation which renders interaction with the system closer to that of inquiry dialogue, then learning at a conceptual level should be enhanced.

Their findings remind us that the majority of university students do not understand the process of evolution but that conceptual change instruction can be moderately effective in promoting the construction of a scientific understanding. The present article details two studies that represent an effort to focus on and define the limits of the Bishop and Anderson (1990) study. Study A describes a close replication of the work of Bishop and Anderson (1990) using the same conceptual‐change teaching module to teach a unit on evolution to students enrolled in a biology course for nonmajors. Study B, a case of comparison, used the same evaluation instrument used in Bishop and Anderson (1990) and Study A, but high school students were the participants and the instruction was based on the inquiry approach to science. Like Bishop and Anderson (1990), Study A showed that the amount of prior instruction and students' beliefs in evolution were not found to be large factors in students' use of scientific conceptions. Unlike the original study, the students in Study A showed only a meager increase in their use of scientific conceptions for evolution. In Study B, students in the experimental group showed significant increases in their use of scientific conceptions. These findings suggest a need to investigate more closely the teachers' theories of learning, their reliance on instructional conversations, and the amount of time devoted to the topic of evolution as we study conceptual change in this area.

Through their interactions, the students also arrived at private meanings that they did not report in their findings and that were often overlooked by teachers who used static end-of-unit tests to measure student learning. In conducting their inquiries, students successfully negotiated courses of actions and established group structures through which they organized their interactions.

In recent years a number of studies have investigated the effect of teachers' epistemologies on the classroom environment, yet little is known about students' epistemologies and how these interact with those of teachers. The purpose of this study was to document students' epistemologies and their concurrent views about knowing and learning. Using a written essay, short‐answer responses to statements, a preferred classroom environment inventory, and interviews, students' views on scientific knowledge and their own knowing and learning were collected from 42 students in three sections of an introductory physics course. Our rather broad, qualitative inquiry provides a dynamic view of students' understanding of knowing and learning in high school physics. Our analyses reveal a spectrum of epistemological commitments commensurable with positions from objectivism to relativism, most of them with experientialist coloring. Even within individuals, these commitments could be at once commensurable and incommensurable with the same epistemological position. We also find rather significant inter‐ and intra‐individual differences with respect to the consequences of a specific epistemological stance to learning, the learning strategies employed, and the learning environment preferred. Students' views on knowing and learning in physics are presented in the form of an emergent theory. The findings are discussed in terms of their application to classroom environments.

By exploring the reasons underlying the adoption of ‘new paradigm’ methods in the social sciences, I argue that their explication of a feminist science lacks an important feature that would hinder its consideration as an alternative vision of scientific inquiry and as a basis for changing the content of science curriculum in schools. I further question their need to look to the social sciences as a model, when many social scientists have turned to the physical sciences for inspiration in attempting to reconstruct their own disciplines. By exploring the tenets most commonly held in present‐day science and examining the nature of scientific understanding, I argue that their view of ‘normal’ science is a highly simplified and incomplete stereotype of scientific inquiry. It is suggested that the nature of science is not the root problem, as Bentley and Watts would have us believe. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

In the SLRF teachers report what happened in their last lesson. Certain items are structured while others are open. A special procedure was developed for the analysis of the open answers. A high level of reliability was obtained by comparing results of teachers' and observers' reports on the same lesson. Two hundred and fifty SLRF's were analyzed and the results are reported to illustrate the kind of information which can be obtained with this instrument. It was found that, on the average, junior high science classes in Israel are inquiry oriented, have abundance of discussions and hands‐on laboratory activities which are closely supervised by the teachers.

Children in both conditions received inquiry-based instruction and identical declarative specifications of preproof geometric concepts such as line, angle, and quadrilateral. In one condition, procedural specifications of the geometry concepts employed traditional construction tools such as protractors and rulers. In the second condition, however, procedural specification of the concepts entailed the use of a modified form of LOGO. After instruction, children responded to measures of attitude, knowledge acquisition, knowledge application, and knowledge organization. The measure of knowledge organization suggested instructionally related differences in the representation of some concepts, with children participating in the traditional condition more likely to attend to surface features of the subject matter. No differences between instructional conditions were observed for either attitude or knowledge acquisition. However, children using LOGO were better able to apply what they had learned. Similar results were obtained at posttest intervals of 10 and 16 weeks. The results suggest that LOGO is an effective means for elaborating children’s procedural interpretations of some preproof geometry concepts. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The study investigated the supposition that observational skills can be influenced by students’ belief in traditional African cosmology, beliefs and superstitions. Data were collected from 319 pre‐degree science students from one of the Nigerian universities using the Traditional Cosmology Test (TCT) and the Test of Observational Skills (TOS). The results showed that students with a high level of belief in African traditional cosmology, made significantly fewer correct observations (p < 0.001) in comparison with those with a low level of belief. There is a strong possibility, as interviews with a random selection of subjects show, that traditional cosmology could have been a major factor responsible for this performance difference in observation. The results of the study have significant implications for curriculum developers and proponents of inquiry‐based science programmes in African classrooms. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

The broad aim of the Projects is to investigate the application of computer-based information handling in both discrete syllabuses and cross-curriculum activities in Primary schools and within the Humanities in Secondary schools. Particular reference is made to skills-based approaches and inquiry learning within these syllabuses. The Projects intend to describe and illustrate the range and types of activities in which information technology can play an integral part and to identify the skills, techniques and the nature of learning that takes place through computer-based information handling. Teacher development in incorporating computer-based approaches, strategies for in-service education of teachers and the influence of computer-based information handling upon curriculum development are also under investigation. The QUEST family of programs and associated utilities are a central feature of the software employed in the Projects. It is proposed that a ""common core"" of information skills exists independently of the subject discipline but which relates both subject-specific collection to subject-specific methodology. The adoption of such approaches, however, influences both the environment within which children's learning takes place and the design of curricula to facilitate such learning. Equally, data handling facilities might be seen to influence the respective roles of child and teacher, the balance between discrete and continuous activities within a curriculum and the requirements for INSET in responding to such facilities. © 1986.","Article","Scopus"

The subjects were 48 Thai schoolchildren from grades 6 and 8. The study used a naturalistic inquiry approach, namely the ‘Interview‐about‐Instances’ technique and the ‘Conceptual Profile Inventory’ technique to analyse the children's responses. The results indicated that Thai schoolchildren hold considerable personal knowledge about the causes of health and sickness that does not derive from school knowledge or from scientific frameworks. This additional knowledge was found to comprise both Thai cultural knowledge and Thai common‐sense interpretations developed from everyday experience within Thai society. In addition, the patterns of conceptual frameworks found in this study reveal that Thai schoolchildren do not perceive concepts related to causes of health and sickness only within the biomedical framework. A number of alternative frameworks are taken into account. These are, for example, nutrition, human habit, human aggression, Thai values systems, religious beliefs, environment, living conditions, socioeconomic status, and family behaviour and attitudes. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Scopus"

Analysis of all relevant data sources, including observations and field notes, videotape and audiotape recordings, student products, and interviews, suggested that several characteristics commonly attributed to students with mild mental retardation were observed to interact with the science curriculum. These characteristics included attention, semantic memory, logical reasoning, and outerdirectedness.

While this perception would be contested by those who see the origins of environmental education lying in the sociopolitical arena of community concerns about exploitation of the environment, it is true to say that environmental education and science education are commonly associated in ways that other disciplines are not, and thus it is perhaps to be expected that the dominant paradigm of evaluation in environmental education should be applied science in character. This article raises the issue of the appropriateness of applied science approaches to evaluation in environmental education. The article begins with a critique of applied science approaches to evaluation, drawing arguments from the broader field of educational evaluation. The relationship between characteristics of applied science approaches to evaluation on the one hand and the special characteristics of environmental education on the other is then explored, and the article concludes with an argument for a deliberative choice of research paradigm in environmental education.

The aptitude was formal reasoning ability and the students were arranged into three groups: high, middle, and low ability reasoners. The treatment was method of forming groups to work in the laboratory. Students in each of three classes were grouped according to reasoning ability. In one class the laboratory groups were homogeneous, i.e., students of similar reasoning ability were grouped together. In the second class the students were grouped heterogeneously, i.e., students of different reasoning ability were grouped together. In the third class, the student choice pattern, the students chose their own partners. The findings were that there were no aptitude treatment interaction for achievement or for gain in formal reasoning ability, that grouping students of similar cognitive ability together for laboratory work in the class was more effective in terms of science achievement than grouping students of differing cognitive ability together or than allowing students to choose their own partners, and that students at different levels of reasoning ability experienced differential gains in that ability over the semester.

Three possible formats were investigated: (1) verification laboratories, (2) guided inquiry laboratories, and (3) open/guided inquiry laboratories. Using several data analysis techniques, LPVI data were used to operationally define the three formats and identify specific criteria for discriminating among them. The use of the Q‐sort, in general, and the LPVI specifically, might fulfill a number of evaluation needs in science education including: (1) developing operational definition of constructs (e.g., “inquiry”), (2) diagnosing problems in curriculum development or implementation, (3) rationalizing differences in treatment groups in educational experiments, and (4) monitoring the effect of teacher education efforts.

The kind of research argued for is complementary to other kinds of research; it aims at description, analysis and understanding of experiences. The relatively distinct field of inquiry indicated by such an orientation is labelled phenomenography. A fundamental distinction is made between two perspectives. From the first-order perspective we aim at describing various aspects of the world and from the second-order perspective (for which a case is made in this paper) we aim at describing people's experience of various aspects of the world. Research in a variety of disciplines, sub-disciplines and ""schools of thought"" has provided us with experiential descriptions, that is, content-oriented and interpretative descriptions of the qualitatively different ways in which people perceive and understand their reality. It has, however, seldom been recognized that these various research efforts share a common perspective in their view of phenomena and a unifying scientific identity has in consequence not been attained. The focussing on the apprehended (experienced, conceptualized,) content as a point of departure for carrying out research and as a basis for integrating the findings is seen as the most distinctive feature of the domain indicated. Conceptions and ways of understanding are not seen as individual qualities. Conceptions of reality are considered rather as categories of description to be used in facilitating the grasp of concrete cases of human functioning. Since the same categories of description appear in different situations, the set of categories is thus stable and generalizable between the situations even if individuals move from one category to another on different occasions. The totality of such categories of description denotes a kind of collective intellect, an evolutionary tool in continual development. © 1981 Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company.","Article","Scopus"

The field study consisted of 14 weeks of weekly observations in the elementary education majors science methods class. Interviews with the students and the instructors as well as survey instruments to assess students' preparation in science were used. Two different approaches to the study of science, one content oriented, the other process oriented, may contribute to the students' confusion, insecurity, and avoidance of science. The students' perception that science is learning content, an objective of introductory level science courses, and the science methods class's objectives of teaching science as a process sets up an “antagonistic dilemma” between the two. Such “antagonistic dilemma” may be manifest in the lack of instructional time accorded to science by elementary educators. The type of science experiences an individual encounters influences their perceptions. To offset student perceptions developed in science courses which stress principally content, the students need science experiences which truly represent science as inquiry. New strategies for the training of elementary education majors in science need to be examined. Copyright © 1983 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company","Article","Scopus"

It was noted, as well, that in natural situations where there was a high incidence of teacher sanctioning behavior, regardless of whether it was predominantly positively toned, the verbal performance of students engaged in inquiry appeared to be negatively influenced even when there were reasonable wait‐times. That is, even in those rare naturally occurring cases where pauses were longer than the mean of one second, and in experiments where pauses and rewards were independently manipulated if sanctioning behaviors were intense, the positive influence on inquiry of the longer pauses appeared to be somewhat mitigated. It became necessary, then, to study reward patterns in the context of inquiry in order to discover whether, in general, overt verbal rewards which we found occurring with tremendous frequency in natural settings, helped or hindered the progress of student inquiry.

Compared with non‐BSCS students the performance and progress of the BSCS students in three cognitive areas, namely biological knowledge, inquiry skills and the understanding of science, demonstrates the feasibility of the BSCS adaptation program for students in academic city schools as well as for those in the Kibbutz rural schools. It is less adequate for most students in agricultural schools as well as for a considerable number of students of non‐European descent. The results indicate that achievement in biology is not unidimensional and that different students reach different levels of achievement with different measures. The implications of the findings regarding program revision, teacher training, adoption as well as further research are discussed. The study may be helpful to other countries which either have adapted or considered the adaptation of programs such as the BSCS.

This conception, which has educational and social importance, may be a significant influence in the teaching of science as inquiry. Thus, concern with teachers' conceptions of the nature of science and their teaching served as justification for this study. The instrument, which was applied to samples of preservice elementary teachers, college philosophy of science students, and college chemistry students, consisted of items that were adapted to the contexts of particular scientific theories by prefacing them with a brief description of a theory and episodes drawn from its history. Items were written to discriminate between alternative conceptions of the following philosophic aspects of scientific theories: testing, generation, ontological implications, and choice. Evidence in support of the validity of the instrument constructs was obtained using two approaches: discrimination between contrasting groups and the multi‐trait and multi‐method matrix of Campbell and Fiske. Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients and standard errors of measurement were computed for the instrument and its subtests. Reliability data indicates that an adequate degree of accuracy may be attributed to instrument scores. Copyright © 1981 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company","Article","Scopus"

Three conditions facilitating inquiry in classroom settings are identified: a focus for attention, freedom, and a responsive environment. The elaboration of these conditions and the shift in motivation which results from creating them are discussed. Examples of the inquiry training process are presented. A pilot study is reported wherein it was discovered that children who rated high on cognitive control, impulsivity, and autonomy were more effective inquirers than children who were low on any of these three factors.

Field methods such as indepth interviewing and observation are used, and the logic of the inquiry is inductive rather than hypothetico‐deductive. The stages of naturalistic research are explained and illustrated with material from the NSF‐sponsored Case Studies in Science Education. Problems in traditional research methods (construct validity, ecological generalization) are presented as justification for inductive models or models based on multiple methods, perspectives, and operations.

Cognitive strategies (such as questioning) are developed best, however, within the framework of an academic subject. In the current study, questioning skills were taught to high school chemistry students in the context of their laboratory experiments. Since both intellectual development and questioning skills are causally related to problem solving, the effect of intellectual development on the learning of questioning skills also was investigated. The Piagetian model of intellectual development was chosen for its demonstrated effects on many important aspects of science instruction. The number and quality of student research questions was measured by the Science Inquiry Assessment Instrument. The student's level of intellectual development was measured by the Classroom Test of Formal Operations. The twelve‐week experimental treatment involved printed lessons which taught students to ask research questions in response to unanticipated observations in their regularly scheduled laboratory experiments. The pretest exaggerated the effect of this treatment. This effect, however, was significant among unpretested students, accounting for 14% of the post‐test score variance. The level of intellectual development has no effect on these post‐test scores. These important questioning skills can be acquired within the framework of the regularly scheduled classroom activities by high school chemistry students, irrespective of their level of Piagetian intellectual development.
