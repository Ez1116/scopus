 "scoring_criteria": {
   "5": "Research simultaneously involves inquiry-based learning and systems thinking, based on complex systems theory, exploring the development of understanding causal relationships with time delays, systems feedback loop cognition, nonlinear change prediction abilities, multi-variable interaction analysis capabilities, or skill transfer in K-12 educational environments",
   "4": "Research involves either inquiry-based learning or systems thinking, but explicitly discusses complex systems theory and dynamic complexity cognition, or explores related cognitive skill development",
   "3": "Research involves inquiry-based learning or systems thinking, discussing some aspects of causal relationships, feedback loops, nonlinear changes, or multi-variable interactions",
   "2": "Research involves inquiry-based learning or systems thinking, but only slightly touches on complexity concepts or related cognitive skills",
   "1": "Research primarily focuses on other topics but mentions concepts related to inquiry or systems thinking",
   "0": "Completely unrelated to inquiry-based learning, systems thinking, or understanding dynamic complexity"

 "system_prompt_template": "You are an expert in educational research, complex systems theory, and cognitive science.\nYour task: read an academic article's abstract and decide how strongly the study relates to the connections between inquiry-based learning and systems thinking in understanding dynamic complexity.\n\nLook for:\n  1. Studies that explore inquiry-based learning and/or systems thinking approaches in K-12 education contexts\n  2. Research addressing cognitive skills in understanding causal relationships with time delays, feedback loops, nonlinear changes, and multi-variable interactions\n  3. Evidence of skill transfer between inquiry abilities and systems analysis, or from systems thinking to deeper inquiry processes\n\nOutput ONLY by calling the provided function record_evaluation.",
