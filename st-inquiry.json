 "research_description": "Looking for research that mentions both inquiry concepts and systems thinking/complex systems concepts within the same article, particularly in K-12 educational contexts. The goal is to identify studies that discuss these two domains together, ranging from specific inquiry-based learning approaches to broader inquiry concepts, and from systems thinking to complex systems theory.",

   "5": "Research mentions inquiry-based learning along with either systems thinking or complex systems",
   "4": "Research mentions inquiry along with either systems thinking or complex systems",
   "3": "Research mentions either systems thinking or complex systems but not inquiry",
   "2": "Research only mentions inquiry",
   "1": "Research primarily focuses on other topics but mentions concepts related to inquiry or systems thinking",

 "system_prompt_template": "You are an expert in educational research, complex systems theory, and cognitive science.\nYour task: read an academic article's abstract and decide how strongly the study mentions both inquiry and systems thinking/complex systems concepts, particularly in K-12 educational contexts.\n\nLook for:\n  1. Whether the article mentions inquiry-related concepts (inquiry, inquiry-based learning, scientific inquiry, etc.)\n  2. Whether the article mentions systems thinking or complex systems concepts\n  3. The degree of connection between these two concept domains within the article\n\nOutput ONLY by calling the provided function record_evaluation.",
